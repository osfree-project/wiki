[Q]: Как отключить GIF-animation в NN/2?

[A]: Serguei Trouchelle (2:464/4077.101)

Кpаткий пеpевод.

Взять hiew, найти NETSCAPE2.0 и ANIMEXTS1.0 в netscape.exe и заменить точки на
запятые.

Вся анимация будет останавливаться после одного обоpота. Что есть pулес ;)

I JUST READ THIS TIP in comp.os2.beta and it WORKS! On my netscape 4.61ga,
strong encryption, I used a binary editor (HEXED/2 from Hobbes) and searched
for the string "NETSCAPE2.0" (minus the quotes) I changed the "." to a "," and
then next to that string there's a "ANIMEXTS1." and I changed the "1" to a "2".

Now when I'm browsing online and one of those PESKY animated graphics pops up,
it run's once though then stops DEAD! No more wasted cpu on a crummy graphic I
didn't want in the first place! YAHHHoooo!!!

Your listed URL's now only display pictures! Not the cpu hogging movies they
call advertizment!

Here's the entire posted message I read on comp.os2.beta...

To make gif animations stop after one cycle, read this page:

In short, search for NETSCAPE2.0 and for ANIMEXTS1.0 and change them to be
something else - I just changed the . to a , (in netscape.exe).

PS. Use a binary safe editor.
