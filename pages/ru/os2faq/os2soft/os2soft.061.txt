======
Virtual PC for OS/2 by default disables sound for guest systems. This is
done to prevent problems such as distorted sound, system
traps, lockups, etc. due to buggy OS/2 sound drivers. For most sound
drivers, it is recommended to not turn on sound support. The
worst results can be experienced with the drivers from Crystal (ISA and
PCI) - usually system traps. In case you have a sound driver
that can handle small buffers and high interrupt rates well (e.g.
Soundblaster Live!), you can try to enable sound support.

To enable sound in VPC/2 guests:

Start regedit2.exe, navigate through the keys:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
SOFTWARE
VPCWIN
REGROOT_HKEY_LOCALMACHINE
SYSTEM

under System, you have to add a key "CustomBuild"
(right mouse button, menu point NEW, KEY)

In this new Key (looks like a folder), you add a DWORD named
"DisableAudio"
(right mouse button, menu point NEW, DWORD value) and leave the default
value of 0.

On the next restart of VPC, your guest should have sound (of course, you
still have to install a SB16 sound driver in your guest... or
in case of Win9x/2K/XP, let the autodetection find the virtual SB16 card
and install the driver...)
voila!
