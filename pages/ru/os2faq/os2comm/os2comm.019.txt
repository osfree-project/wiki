NETWORKING THE OS/2 PEER REQUESTER WITH MS-Workgroups for Windows
-----------------------------------------------------------------

What you'll need:

  a.  Windows for workgroups
  b.  os/2 2.1x or os/2 2.1x for windows
  c.  Network transport services/2 (NTS/2)
  d.  OS/2 Lan Requester

  I'm not sure of all available sources for (c) and (d) above, but I know
they come with LAN server.  Several Os/2 catalogs (IE: corner store) list
"OS/lan requester licencse" for $49 or so, but I am note sure if that comes
with the disks for NTS/2 and the OS/2 lan requester.

(1) Before worrying about the OS/2 machine(s), get your MS-Workgroups for
windows setup.  When Windows asks for a "workgroup" name, pick a name that
is also an OS/2 compatible domain name (IE: 8 chars or less, no spaces).
When windows asks for a "machine name", again pick an os/2 compatible one (8
chars, etc).

(2) Now for the OS/2 machine(s).  Install Network Transport Services/2
(NTS/2).  NTS/2 is the package that contains the lower-layer (IE: NDIS)
drivers for OS/2.  NTS/2 comes with support for a number of network cards.
When you install NTS/2, one of the options is for what "protocols" to
support on your card.  Make sure you include support for "NETBIOS".

(3) Reboot and make sure all of the NTS/2 drivers which were added to your
CONFIG.SYS come up properly.  If they don't, their is no reason to go on to
the next step.  If anyone has any problems getting the NTS/2 stuff to come
up, drop my a line and I'll try to help.

(3) Next, install the OS/2 Lan Requester on your OS/2 Machine(s).  Don't
do the "base" install, do a custom one.  Install at least the
base-requester and peer-requester options.  When the install program asks
for a DOMAIN name, use the same name as you used for your MS4WG "workgroup".
You can use whatever you want for the machine/requester name, but lets
assume you use "OS2PEER" as the machine/requester name.
When the OS/2 lan requester install is done, it will tell you that the
default user ID and password are "USERID" and "PASSWORD".

(4) Reboot and verify that the OS/2 lan requester drivers come up properly.
If it doesn't, their is no reason to go on to the next step.  Again, if
anyone has any problems just drop me a note and I'll try to help.

(5) Go to an OS/2 screen or window.  If you didn't specify to automatically
start the requester via STARTUP.CMD, type "NET START REQ" at the os/2
prompt.  Next you need to share your drives.  For example, to share your C:
drive, type "NET SHARE C=C:\ /USERS:1 /PERMISSIONS:XRWCDA".  "NET SHARE"
is the command that tells the OS/2 peer requester to share something.
"C=C:\" tells the requester to share, under the network name "C", your
"C:" drive, "\" (root) directory; with all permissions, (IE: e"X"ecute,
"R"ead, "W"rite, etc)

(6) On your W4WG machine, login using the name "USERID" and "PASSWORD" for
the password.  These are the defaults used by the OS/2 peer requester.  Go
to the file manager. Select "Connect network drive". Eventually, a dialog
will come up showing you what "shared directories" you can connect to.  The
OS/2 peer-requester machine will not be listed, but it is available!  Go to
the "Path" input field, and type "\\OS2PEER" (or whatever name you used for
the os/2 peer requester/machine) and press <ENTER>. Walla! The OS/2 peer
requester and it's shared directories ("C" if you followed the example in
#5) will be on the list.  Click on the "C" shared-directory, press OK, and
bang, your connected.

(7) to connect to drives on your W4WG machine _from_ os/2, share your drives
on the W4WG machine via the normal mechanmism (IE: use the File Manager
"share as" menu option).  Don't specify any passwords, and set the access
typ to whatever you want (IE: read only, full)  For our examples, lets say
you share your W4WG machine's C:\ directory under the share name "C", and
your W4WG machine is named "Bill".  NEXT, Goto an OS/2 window or screen, and
at the prompt type "NET USE F: \\BILL\C".  This command tells the OS/2
requester to "USE" "\\BILL\C" on the W4WG machine as the local "F:" drive.

All of this is working great on my machine.  The only caveats I have are (1)
4OS2 (a replacement shell that can be used instaed of os/2s CMD.EXE)
seems to have some problems with this setup; and (2) when connecting to a
w4wg drive from an os/2 peer, some programs running on the os/2 machine
cause os/2 to report "write errors" when writing to the w4wg drive.  No
actuall errors seem to occur--os/2 just reports that they are happening.

Also, I'm running on NE2000 cards which are not natively supported by NTS/2.
I had to get a copy of 2000NDIS.EXE which is a self-extracting zip which
includes OS/2 NDIS / NTS/2 drivers for the NE2000.
