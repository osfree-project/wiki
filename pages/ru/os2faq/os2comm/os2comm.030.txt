[Q]: Как избавиться от Propagate Access пpи смене CD?

[A]: Alex Zimarev (2:5020/468.5)

расшарить CD-ROM в LS 4 можно и с помощью GUI (в третьем нельзя).

1. Создается алиас, например CD для ресурса D:\, где D: - CD-ROM.
2. Hа вопрос о создании access profile надо сказать <Hе создавать>
3. Пойти в OS/2 System -> Drives, нажать правую кнопку мыши на иконке CD-ROM,
   выбрать Manage access и задать необходимые permissions.

OK this time I am at work with the might of IBM's databases
behind me so I wil just cut and pase a bit.

***************************************************
DETAILS OF RESOLUTION
    There are two ways to set up a CD-ROM on the LAN.  The
    first example is done from the command line, but must be
    done each time the server is rebooted.  (It could be put
    in the STARTUP.CMD.)  The second way, done from the
    LAN Requester Full Screen Interface, takes a little more
    time to set up; but it does not have to be done each time
    the server is rebooted.

    Note:  In the following examples:
                    SERVNAME = The name of the server with the
                               CD-ROM
                    NETCDROM = The CD-ROM netname
                    CDROMAL  = The CD-ROM alias
                    E:       = The local drive letter assigned to
                               the CD-ROM
                    K:       = The redirected drive at the requester

    1.  This example is done from the command line on the server
        where the CD-ROM is installed:

        a.  At the OS/2 command line, do a NET SHARE.
            Example: NET SHARE NETCDROM=E:
        b.  Create an access control profile.
            Example: NET ACCESS E: /ADD
        c.  Grant access to the users.
            Example: NET ACCESS E: /GRANT USERS:R GUEST:R
        d.  At the requester, do a NET USE.
            Example: NET USE K: \\SERVNAME\NETCDROM
        NOTE:  The access profile must be for "E:" not "E:\";
               otherwise an APPLY will have to be done after each
               CD-ROM change.

    2.  This example is done from the LAN Requester Full Screen
    Interface on the server where the CD-ROM is installed:

    a.  Define an alias for the CD-ROM drive root directory:
        1)  From the LAN Requester Main Panel, select
            Definitions, then select Aliases from the popup.
        2)  From the Aliases panel, select Files.
        3)  From the Manage Aliases - Files panel, select
            --NEW--, then select Create from the popup.
        4)  Complete the Create Aliases - Files panel:
                Alias:                        CDROMAL
                Server name:                  SERVNAME
                Server path to directory:     E:\
                When shared:                  At server startup

     b.  Create the access control profile for the CD-ROM:
         1)  From the LAN Requester Main Panel, select
             Definitions, then Access Controls from the popup.
         2)  From Manage Access Control - Aliases, F10 to the
             Action Bar, and select Servers, then Enter on the
             Display Profiles by Server popup.
         3)  From List of Servers, select --Here--.
         4)  From Manage Access Control - Non-Alias, select
             --New--, F10 to the Action bar, then select
             Create on the popup.
         5)  On the Create an Access Control Profile, enter or
             select the following:
                 Profile type:     E: (DO NOT add a \; eg, E:\)
                 Resource Type:    File
                 Permissions for
                     User Group:   XR
         6)  On Manage Access Control - Non-alias, select the
             profile created in the previous step (eg. E:).
             F10 to the Action bar, selection Actions, then
             select User List from the popup.
         7)  From Access Control Profile User List, cursor to
             Guest and enter XR in Permissions.
         8)  From Manage Access Control - Non-alias, select E:.
             F10 to the action bar and select Actions, then
             Apply from the popup.
         9)  At the next popup, verify the drive letter is
             correct, then press Enter to proceed.  (This will
             search all the files currently loaded in the CD-ROM
             and create many entries.)
             NOTE:  A CD must be in the CD-ROM drive.

     c.  Delete all the access control profiles for the
         CD-ROM EXCEPT E:.  (This is the only access
         control required for the drive.)

     d.  At the requester, use the alias to access the shared
         CD-ROM:
                NET USE K: CDROMAL

You need to create a profile for the root drive without the backslash, and do 
*not* bother to "apply" the profile.

If CDROM is the F drive on the file server. Creat an alias eg
Alias name : CDROM1
Directory  : F:\
server  : bla bla

Then go to the Definitons menu, select Access Control Profiles, Select
By Server.
Highlight the new option, and then create.
Enter a resource of F:    (note no backslash or anything)
Users Permissions    :  whatever you want
Then create access by Group and Users as required.
