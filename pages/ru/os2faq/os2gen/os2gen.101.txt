What is "l_ms_os2.zip"?
-----------------------
The file "l_ms_os2.zip" contains a replacement mouse driver ("mouse.sys") for
the Dell/Logitech Dovebar SR14 3.0 version mouse.  It also works for my
Logitech MouseMan Sensa three-button mouse under OS/2 3.0 ("Warp").  It might
also work for other recent Logitech mice that confuse OS/2.  Please let me
know of your experiences, positive or negative.

This driver appears to have been written for a version of OS/2 prior to OS/2
3.0.  The "readme" file accompanying it when I retrieved it from the OS/2
Shareware BBS (+1 703 385 4325, USA) did not fit OS/2 3.0.  Therefore, I added
this text, which applies to OS/2 3.0.  The original "readme" text is
appended to this file for the benefit of OS/2 2.x users.

That's all I know about "l_ms_os2.zip".

Problem solved by this mouse driver
-----------------------------------
The problems I experienced were the same regardless of which mouse driver I
selected during installation of OS/2 3.0.  I tried the default driver and
both of the Logitech drivers.  The problem was that my computer would stop
responding to the right mouse button, or all the buttons, or all mouse and
keyboard buttons (system crash).

This driver does not enable the third (middle) button.  It just allows the
mouse to work as a two-button mouse.

Contents of zip file
--------------------
The file "l_ms_os2.zip" unzips to "mouse.sys", "readme" and "mouse.ddp".
"mouse.sys" is the replacement mouse driver.  "readme" is what you're reading
right now.  I don't know what "mouse.ddp" is for, but it's probably for an
earlier version of OS/2.  It is not needed for OS/2 3.0, but it's included
for the benefit of OS/2 2.x users.
