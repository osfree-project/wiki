[Q]: How to remove a volume label?

[A]: Mark Lewis (1:3634/12)

i just found that 'label d:[alt-1]' causes the label to be removed...

D:\>ver

The Operating System/2 Version is 3.00

D:\>vol

The volume label in drive D is FRED.
The Volume Serial Number is A7CD:4415.

D:\>label d:^A

D:\>vol

Volume in drive D has no label.
The Volume Serial Number is A7CD:4415.


the same thing with

D:\>ver

4OS2/32 2.51   OS/2 Version is 3.0

except that the ^A doesn't show on the screen...

Warp 3 w/no fixpaks...
