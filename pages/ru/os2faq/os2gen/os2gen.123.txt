[Q]: USB setup HOW-TO

[A]: Peter Knapper (3:772/1.10)

Here are my Config.Sys entries for USB -

BASEDEV=USBUHCD.SYS
BASEDEV=USBD.SYS /REQ:USBUHCD$
DEVICE=E:\OS2\BOOT\USBPRT.SYS
BASEDEV=USBHID.SYS

Line 1 is the driver for the USB chipset on my (ASUS) motherboard,
Line 2 is for generic USB support under OS/2,
Line 3 is for generic USB Printer support,
Line 4 is for the USB management S/W.

NOTE: I used the same PRINTER driver for my EPSON STYLUS 700 for either port
type.

The real catch is setting up the correct PRINTER port to be used, and also
indicating what actual printer equates to LPT1, LPT2, LPT3 and PRN, etc... Once
I figured it all out its easy to swap things around, but as I said above it
looks like I am stuck with parallell printing at the moment.
