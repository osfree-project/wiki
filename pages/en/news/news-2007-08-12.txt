==== August 12th, 2007 ====

Today we started uploading the sources to SVN with the aim to configure 
a common build system. As we do not yet have an own SVN-Server yet, we 
are using the SourceForge Server. You can find the sources at 
[[https://sourceforge.net/projects/osfree/]]. At the moment this is 
NOT fully functional, not even all parts of the sources have been 
uploaded. Still feel free to improve osFree
