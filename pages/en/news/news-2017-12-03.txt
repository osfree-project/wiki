Migration to Genode is started.

We started to create the required abstraction layers to make the osFree
OS/2 personality more portable. This will allow us to also create L4Re
and Genode ports. As our OS/2 personality is currently based on an outdated
and abandoned L4Env OS framework, we need to migrate to a more alive and
developing framework. Most promising is Genode OS framework, though, L4Re,
which is a successor for L4Env is also evolving and it supports more hardware
platforms, than Genode. So, ideally, we need ports of our OS/2 personality
to both. Currently, Genode has more priority, the port is in progress.
