The osFree web team has decided to change several things. First and 
foremost, unregistered users cannot comment on news stories. Secondly, 
the ability for you to register your own account has been disabled to 
prevent spam dummy accounts from registering. From now on, you must 
request an osFree wiki account either by contacting the admins (if 
you are a developer you probably already received an account from 
one of the admins) via email or the forums. These changes were 
initiated as a preemptive retaliation to a recently registered 
spam account.
