==== June 8, 2007 ====

The dotProject portion of our site has been restored after a long time of being 
unable to be used by either guests or the osFree staff, upgraded as there was an 
oppertuinity to do so. In addition to this recently we’ve had a large amount of 
downtime due to some big problems with one of our host’s hard drives. But now, 
you can now enjoy viewing the site again and most importantly the project’s status.
