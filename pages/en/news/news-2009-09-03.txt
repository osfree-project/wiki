0.0.4 release

We released this preview to show actual possibility of LX executables 
(native OS/2 executable file format) to be run on top of L4. Output 
from LX executable is "I am really small!" phrase. Other things are 
debug output. Our executable uses msg.dll which uses doscalls.dll. 
So, linking also works. Also we present here osFree loader which 
allows to load as Multiboot compatible kernels as native OS/2 kernel. 
Loader is modular and easy to extend. Next release will provide some 
interactive like directory browsing and files execution. See roadmap 
at www.osfree.org for more info.
