FreePM project now part of osFree project

FreePM project now part of osFree project. All source base now in osFree SVN and some goals 
slightly changed (like SOM interfaces instead of C++ interfaces and binary level compatibility,
instead of source level compatibility). Most of services disabled and now osFree project services 
must be used. Thanks to Evgen Kotsuba for the help.
