RSS feeds repaired, the fight with spambots seems to reach the end

After server crash at the end of 2012, the site is being repaired from 
Feb.-Mar. 2013 until now. Now the wiki is being filled with info (some 
of which is restored from web.archive.org), and parts of Forum too. So, 
welcome to our new site! Also, until now, some code were committed to 
the repo (namely, fat32.ifs with FORMAT routine enabled (by valerius), 
and also commits by Viking, fixing some problems with build system under 
linux etc.)
