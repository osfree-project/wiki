I'd like to help out with the DOS commands if you need a hand.  My time is limited right now but I will eventually have more time to help out on other things.  I could send my resume if you want to see my background.  I also have lots of hardware and software to test and play with.  Email me and let me know.  [email hidden for spam protect]  By the way, I couldn't figure out how to get a log-on to your forums so I registered on your web site.
