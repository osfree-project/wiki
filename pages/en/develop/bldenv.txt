===== Building and Developing =====

==== General description of osFree build system =====

For  compilation,  fix  build.conf  to  suit  your  system.  (There are 3
versions  of  build.conf  for  OS/2, Linux and Windows in the root directory.
Also developer-specific config exists with names like build-valerius.conf,
build-prokushev.conf, etc).
OpenWatcom  compiler  is used for development. I tried OpenWatcom versions 1.3
as  well  as  1.5.  Also,  for *.cmd scripts a REXX language interpreter is
needed.      For      Linux      and     Windows     users     Regina     REXX
(http://regina-rexx.sourceforge.net/)  may  be  used.  Before compilation, for
setting  environment  variables,  use  setvars{.cmd  --  for OS/2, .bat -- for
Windows, and .sh -- for Linux}.
