====== DosGetSTDA ======

===== Brief =====

The DosGetSTDA API is a 16-bit API that returns a copy of the system trace
buffer (STDA).

===== Syntax =====

<code c>
APIENTRY DosGetSTDA( SEL, SHORT, SHORT );
</code>

===== Parameters =====

  * SEL is the selector to the private buffer
  * SHORT is the offset to the private buffer
  * SHORT is the size of the buffer (maximum value = 64KB) records

===== Returns =====

Returns:
  * NO_ERROR - indicates correct operation, buffer is now filled with copy of the system trace buffer
  * ERROR_SYSTEM_TRACE - System trace is not enabled

===== Remarks =====


DosGetSTDA returns a buffer that contains a copy of the system trace buffer.
The buffer is circular with a header record that contains pointers to the first and
last data bytes and a pointer to the next byte that was available for writing (the
buffer is a snapshot of the system trace buffer at the time that the API was
called). A set of trace records follows the header. Each trace record contains a
trace event trailer and optionally a timestamp and/or a data field. A timestamp
record is optional and will only exist if bit 2 of the flag field in the Trace Event
Trailer is set to OFF.

The trace event data contains the information describing each individual trace
event. The events traced may be from OS/2 system supplied or other user
supplied trace points. In either case the data is dependent on each individual
trace point. Descriptions of the data and formatting instructions for the OS/2
system supplied trace points can be found in the OS/2 Debugging Library,
Volume 3 - System Trace Points Reference.
