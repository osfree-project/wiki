rc (USHORT) - return:Return code descriptions are:

  * 505 ERROR_MOU_EXTENDED_SG

===== Remarks =====

Processes issuing MouDeRegister calls must conform to the following rules:

  *The process that issued the MouRegister must release the session (by a MouDeRegister) from the registered subsystem before another PID may issue MouRegister. 
  *The process that issued the MouRegister is the only process that may issue MouDeRegister against the currently registered subsystem. 
  *After the owning process has released the subsystem with a MouDeRegister, any other process in the session may issue a MouRegister and therefore modify the mouse support for the entire session.
