====== DosReallocSeg ======

This call reallocates a segment after discard or changes the size of a segment already allocated.

====== Syntax ======
<code c>
DosReallocSeg (Size, Selector)
</code>

====== Parameters ======

  * Size ([[USHORT]]) - input : New requested segment size (in bytes). A value of 0 indicates 65536 bytes.
  * Selector ([[SEL]]) - input : Segment to be resized.

====== Return Code ======

rc ([[USHORT]]) - return

Return code descriptions are:

  * 0        NO_ERROR
  * 5        ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED
  * 8        ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY

====== Remarks ======

DosReallocSeg is called to change the size of an unshared or shared segment allocated with a [[DosAllocSeg]] request.

Normally, segments allocated as shared (AllocFlags bits 0 and 1 were set) cannot be decreased in size. However, if AllocFlags bit 3 was also set, the shared segment's size can be decreased.

DosReallocSeg is also called to reallocate a segment allocated as discardable (AllocFlags bit 2 set) after the segment is discarded by the system. The call to DosReallocSeg automatically locks the segment for access by the caller, the same as if a DosLockSeg had been issued.

Note: This request may be issued from privilege level 2 or 3, and the segment being resized can be either a privilege level 2 or privilege level 3 segment.

To change the size of huge memory allocated by DosAllocHuge, see DosReallocHuge.

===== Family API Considerations =====

Some options operate differently in the DOS mode than in the OS/2 mode. Therefore, the following restriction applies to DosReallocSeg when coding for the DOS mode. The requested Size value is rounded up to the next paragraph (16-byte). 
====== Bindings ======

===== C Binding =====

<code c>
#define INCL_DOSMEMMGR

USHORT  rc = DosReallocSeg(Size, Selector);

USHORT           Size;          /* New size requested in bytes */
SEL              Selector;      /* Selector */

USHORT           rc;            /* return code */
</code>
===== MASM Binding =====

<code asm>
EXTRN  DosReallocSeg:FAR
INCL_DOSMEMMGR      EQU 1

PUSH   WORD    Size          ;New size requested in bytes
PUSH   WORD    Selector      ;Selector
CALL   DosReallocSeg

Returns WORD
