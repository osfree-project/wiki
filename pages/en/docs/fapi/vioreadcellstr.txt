====== VioReadCellStr ======

This call reads a string of character-attribute pairs (cells) from the screen, starting at the specified location.

===== Syntax =====
<code c>
VioReadCellStr (CellStr, Length, Row, Column, VioHandle)
</code>
===== Parameters =====

  * CellStr ([[PCH]]) - output : Address of the buffer where the cell string is returned.
  * Length ([[PUSHORT]]) - input/output : Address of the buffer length in bytes. Length must take into account that each character-attribute(s) entry in the buffer is 2 or 4 bytes. If the length of the buffer is not sufficient, the last entry is not complete.
  * Row ([[USHORT]]) - input : Starting row of the field to read, 0 is the top row.
  * Column ([[USHORT]]) - input : Starting column of the field to read, 0 is the leftmost column.
  * VioHandle ([[HVIO]]) - input : This must be zero unless the caller is a Presentation Manager application, in which case it must be the value returned by VioGetPs.

===== Return Code =====

===== Remarks =====

If a string read comes to the end of the line and is not complete, the string read continues at the beginning of the next line. If the read comes to the end of the screen and is not complete, the read terminates and the length is set to the length of the buffer that was filled.

====PM Considerations====
VioReadCellStr reads a string of character/attributes (or cells) from the Advanced VIO presentation space starting at the specified location. 

===== Bindings =====

==== C Binding====
<code c>
#define INCL_VIO

USHORT  rc = VioReadCellStr(CellStr, Length, Row, Column, VioHandle);

PCH              CellStr;       /* Cell string buffer */
PUSHORT          Length;        /* Length of cell string buffer */
USHORT           Row;           /* Starting row location */
USHORT           Column;        /* Starting column location */
HVIO             VioHandle;     /* Video handle */

USHORT           rc;            /* return code */
</code>

====MASM Binding====
<code asm>
EXTRN  VioReadCellStr:FAR
INCL_VIO            EQU 1

PUSH@  OTHER   CellStr       ;Cell string buffer
PUSH@  WORD    Length        ;Length of cell string buffer
PUSH   WORD    Row           ;Starting row location
PUSH   WORD    Column        ;Starting column location
PUSH   WORD    VioHandle     ;Video handle
CALL   VioReadCellStr

Returns WORD
