===== Roadmap of OS/2 personality development =====

**Architecture**:

osFree [[en:docs:os2:architecture|OS/2 personality]] proposed architecture.

**Stages**:

  - source level compatability (recompilation of programs with source code without modifications)
  - 32-bit compatability (execution of 32-bit only executables). Note: is much of such applications?
  - Loading of mixed 16/32 bit applications with attempt to replace 16 bit functions calls to 32-bit versions of API function

Final level of compatability:

We have a plan to provide only application level compatability. Reuse of kernel-mode driver not planned at all.
