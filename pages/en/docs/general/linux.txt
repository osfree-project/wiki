===== GNU/Linux personality =====

==== Concept ====

  - Reuse
  - Reuse
  - Reuse

 We have no goal to have GNU/Linux personality as dominant personality. Our primary personality is OS/2. So, GNU/Linux personality only to prevent constant porting process. We donâ€™t want to loss forces for recompilation, adding support of new platforms, architectures and so on. So, we have following plan for Linux personality: 

  - Reuse existent distribution
  - Reuse Nitpicker for windowing subsystems integration
  - Reuse console server for forwarding of GNU/Linux consoles

 Nothing more (in general) from GNU/Linux personality planned to reuse.
