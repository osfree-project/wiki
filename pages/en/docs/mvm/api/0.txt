===== Brief =====

===== Input =====

  * BX = file handle

===== Return =====

  * CF clear if successful
    * AX = new handle
  * CF set on error
    * AX = error code (04h,06h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)

===== Notes =====

moving file pointer for either handle will also move it for the other, because both will refer to the same system file table

for DOS versions prior to 3.3, file writes may be forced to disk by duplicating the file handle and closing the duplicate
