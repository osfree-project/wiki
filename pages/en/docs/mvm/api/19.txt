===== Brief =====

Set current directory

===== Input =====

  * DS:DX -> ASCIZ pathname to become current directory (max 64 bytes)

===== Return =====

  * CF clear if successful
    * AX destroyed
  * CF set on error
    * AX = error code (03h) (path not found)

===== Notes =====

if new directory name includes a drive letter, the default drive is not changed, only the current directory on that drive
          
changing the current directory also changes the directory in which FCB file calls operate
