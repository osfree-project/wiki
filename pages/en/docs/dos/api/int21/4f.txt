====== Int 21H, AH=4FH ======

===== Version =====

2 and higher

===== Brief =====

"FINDNEXT" - FIND NEXT MATCHING FILE

===== Family API =====


===== Input =====

	AH = 4Fh
	Disk Transfer Area contains data block from previous FindFirst or
	  FindNext call

===== Return =====

  CF clear if successful
	    Disk Transfer Area updated
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (12h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)

===== Notes =====

	under Novell DOS 7, if the FindFirst call (AH=4Eh) had CX=0088h, then
	  the next matching deleted file will be returned
	since the entire state of a FindFirst/FindNext sequence is contained
	  in the data block in the DTA, other disk operations such as renaming,
	  moving, deleting, or creating files can cause inaccurate directory
	  searches, such as finding the same file twice
   BUG:	DR DOS 3.41 and 5.0 return the Directory attribute for the volume label
