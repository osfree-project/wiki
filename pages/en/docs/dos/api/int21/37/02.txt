====== Int 21H, AH=37H, AL=02H ======

===== Version =====

2.x and 3.3+ only

===== Brief =====

get availdev flag

===== Family API =====



===== Input =====

        AH = 37h
        AL = 02h get availdev flag

===== Return =====

 AL = status
            00h successful
            FFh unsupported subfunction
 DL = 00h \DEV\ must precede character device names
                           = nonzero \DEV\ is optional

===== Macro =====


===== Notes =====

all versions of DOS from 2.00 allow \DEV\ to be prepended to device names without generating an error even if the directory \DEV does not actually exist (other paths generate an error if they do not exist); DOS 2.x has an AVAILDEV= option in CONFIG.SYS to make \DEV mandatory
          
although MS-DOS 3.3+, DR DOS 3.41+, and Novell DOS 7 accept these calls, they have no effect, and AL=02h always returns DL=FFh (except for Novell DOS 7, which leaves AX unchanged for both subfunctions)
