GET SWITCH CHARACTER

===== Family API =====

            00h successful
                DL = current switch character
            FFh unsupported subfunction

===== Macro =====


===== Notes =====

  Determine the character which is used to introduce command switches.
          This setting is ignored by MS-DOS commands in version 4.0 and higher,
          but is honored by many third-party programs and by Novell DOS 7
          external commands
BUG:    Novell DOS 7's COMMAND.COM (prior to Update 15) fails to honor the
         SwitChar setting for internal commands even though COMMAND.COM
          honors it in its own command tail (i.e. COMMAND /?); even in Update
          15, internal commands fail to honor SwitChar for the /? help option
  documented in some OEM versions of some releases of DOS
        supported by OS/2 compatibility box
        always returns AL=00h/DL=2Fh for MS-DOS 5+ and DR DOS 3.41-6.0
        Novell DOS 7 COMMAND.COM indicates switch characters other than '/'
          by changing the first backslash (and only the first one) in the
          path it prints for PROMPT $p with a forward slash
