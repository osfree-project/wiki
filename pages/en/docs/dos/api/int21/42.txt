====== Int 21H, AH=42H ======

===== Version =====

2 and higher

===== Brief =====

"LSEEK" - SET CURRENT FILE POSITION

===== Family API =====


===== Input =====

        AH = 42h
        AL = origin of move
            00h start of file
            01h current file position
            02h end of file
        BX = file handle
        CX:DX = (signed) offset from origin of new file position

===== Return =====

 CF clear if successful
            DX:AX = new file position in bytes from start of file
        CF set on error
            AX = error code (01h,06h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)

===== Notes =====

for origins 01h and 02h, the pointer may be positioned before the start of the file; no error is returned in that case (except under Windows NT), but subsequent attempts at I/O will produce errors
          
if the new position is beyond the current end of file, the file will be extended by the next write (see AH=40h); for FAT32 drives, the file must have been opened with AX=6C00h with the "extended size" flag in order to expand the file beyond 2GB
          
BUG:    using this method to grow a file from zero bytes to a very large size can corrupt the FAT in some versions of DOS; the file should first be grown from zero to one byte and then to the desired large size
