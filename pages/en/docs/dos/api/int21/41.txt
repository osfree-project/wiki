====== Int 21H, AH=41H ======

===== Version =====

2 and higher

===== Brief =====

"UNLINK" - DELETE FILE

===== Family API =====


===== Input =====

        AH = 41h
        DS:DX -> ASCIZ filename (no wildcards, but see notes)
        CL = attribute mask for deletion (server call only, see notes)

===== Return =====

 CF clear if successful
            AX destroyed (DOS 3.3) AL seems to be drive of deleted file
        CF set on error
            AX = error code (02h,03h,05h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)

===== Notes =====


  (DOS 3.1+) wildcards are allowed if invoked via AX=5D00h, in which case
          the filespec must be canonical (as returned by AH=60h), and only
          files matching the attribute mask in CL are deleted
        DR DOS 5.0-6.0 returns error code 03h if invoked via AX=5D00h; DR DOS
          3.41 crashes if called via AX=5D00h with wildcards
        DOS does not erase the file's data; it merely becomes inaccessible
          because the FAT chain for the file is cleared
        deleting a file which is currently open may lead to filesystem
          corruption.  Unless SHARE is loaded, DOS does not close the handles
          referencing the deleted file, thus allowing writes to a nonexistant
          file.
        under DR DOS and DR Multiuser DOS, this function will fail if the file
          is currently open
        under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the pointer is in DS:EDX
  BUG:    DR DOS 3.41 crashes if called via AX=5D00h
