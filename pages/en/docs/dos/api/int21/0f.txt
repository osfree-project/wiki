====== Int 21H, AH=0FH ======

===== Version =====

1 and higher

===== Brief =====

OPEN FILE USING FCB

===== Family API =====

[[en:docs:fapi:DosOpen]]

===== Input =====

        AH = 0Fh
        DS:DX -> unopened File Control Block (see #01345,#01346)

===== Return =====

AL = status
           * 00h successful
           * FFh file not found or access denied

===== Notes =====

Notes:  (DOS 3.1+) file opened for read/write in compatibility mode
        an unopened FCB has the drive, filename, and extension fields filled
          in and all other bytes cleared
        not supported by MS Windows 3.0 DOSX.EXE DOS extender
        DR DOS checks password attached with AX=4303h
        (FAT32 drive) this function will only succeed for creating a volume
          label; FAT32 does not support FCBs for file I/O
BUG:    APPEND for DOS 3.3+ corrupts DX if the file is not found
