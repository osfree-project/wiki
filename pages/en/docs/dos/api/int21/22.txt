WRITE RANDOM RECORD TO FCB FILE

===== Family API =====


===== Input =====

        AH = 22h
        DS:DX -> opened FCB (see #01345)
        Disk Transfer Area contains record to be written

===== Return =====

            00h successful
            01h disk full
            02h segment wrap in DTA

===== Notes =====

  the record is written to the current file position as specified by the
          random record and record size fields of the FCB
        the file position is not updated after writing the record
        if the record is located beyond the end of the file, the file is
          extended but the intervening data remains uninitialized
        if the record only partially fills a disk sector, it is copied to a
          DOS disk buffer to be written out to disk at a later time
        not supported by MS Windows 3.0 DOSX.EXE DOS extender
