===== Brief =====

PARSE FILENAME INTO FCB

===== Family API =====


===== Input =====

        AH = 29h
        AL = parsing options (see #01380)
        DS:SI -> filename string (both '*' and '?' wildcards OK)
        ES:DI -> buffer for unopened FCB

===== Return =====

 AL = result code
            00h successful parse, no wildcards encountered
            01h successful parse, wildcards present
            FFh failed (invalid drive specifier)
        DS:SI -> first unparsed character
        ES:DI buffer filled with unopened FCB (see #01345)

===== Notes =====

  asterisks in the name are expanded to question marks in the FCB
        all processing stops when a filename terminator is encountered
        cannot be used with filespecs which include a path (DOS 2+)
        Novell NetWare monitors the result code since an 'invalid drive' may
          signal an attempt to reconnect a network drive; if there are no
          connections to the specified drive, NetWare attempts to build a
          connection and map the drive to the SYS:LOGIN directory
         
Bitfields for parsing options:
Bit(s)  Description     (Table 01380)
 0      skip leading separators
 1      use existing drive number in FCB if no drive is specified, instead of
          setting field to zero
 2      use existing filename in FCB if no base name is specified, instead of
          filling field with blanks
 3      use existing extension in FCB if no extension is specified, instead of
          filling field with blanks
 4-7    reserved (0)
