===== Brief =====

"CHMOD" - SET FILE ATTRIBUTES

===== Family API =====


===== Input =====

        AX = 4301h
        CX = new file attributes (see #01420)
        DS:DX -> ASCIZ filename

===== Return =====

 CF clear if successful
            AX destroyed
        CF set on error
            AX = error code (01h,02h,03h,05h) (see #01680 at AH=59h)
===== Macro =====


===== Notes =====

  will not change volume label or directory attribute bits, but will
          change the other attribute bits of a directory (the directory
          bit must be cleared to successfully change the other attributes of a
          directory, but the directory will not be changed to a normal file as
          a result)
        MS-DOS 4.01 reportedly closes the file if it is currently open
        for security reasons, the Novell NetWare execute-only bit can never
          be cleared; the file must be deleted and recreated
        under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the filename pointer is in DS:EDX
        DOS 5.0 SHARE will close the file if it is currently open in sharing-
          compatibility mode, otherwise a sharing violation critical error is
          generated if the file is currently open
        DR DOS 3.41/5.0 will silently ignore attempts to change the 'directory'
          attribute bit

Bitfields for file attributes:
Bit(s)  Description     (Table 01420)
 7      shareable (Novell NetWare)
 7      pending deleted files (Novell DOS, OpenDOS)
 6      unused
 5      archive
 4      directory
 3      volume label
        execute-only (Novell NetWare)
 2      system
 1      hidden
 0      read-only
