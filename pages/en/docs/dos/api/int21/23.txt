====== Int 21H, AH=23H ======

===== Version =====

1 and higher

===== Brief =====

GET FILE SIZE FOR FCB

===== Family API =====


===== Input =====

        AH = 23h
        DS:DX -> unopened FCB (see #01345), wildcards not allowed

===== Return =====

 AL = status
            00h successful (matching file found)
                FCB random record field filled with size in records, rounded up
                to next full record
            FFh failed (no matching file found)

===== Notes =====

not supported by MS Windows 3.0 DOSX.EXE DOS extender

MS-DOS returns nonsense if the FCB record number field is set to a very large positive number, and status FFh if negative; DR DOS returns the correct file size in both cases

BUG:    APPEND for DOS 3.3+ corrupts DX if the file is not found
