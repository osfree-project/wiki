====== Int 21H, AH=06H ======

===== Version =====

1 and higher

===== Brief =====

DIRECT CONSOLE OUTPUT/INPUT

===== Family API =====

[[en:docs:fapi:DosWrite]] [[en:docs:fapi:DosRead]]

===== Input =====

  AH = 06h
  DL = output character (except FFh)
  DL = FFh - input character
  

===== Return =====

On output:

  AL = character output (despite official docs which state nothing is returned) (at least DOS 2.1-7.0)

On input:

  ZF set if no character available
            AL = 00h

  ZF clear if character available
            AL = character read

===== Notes =====

 does not check ^C/^Break

 writes to standard output, which is always the screen under DOS 1.x, but may be redirected under DOS 2+

 if the returned character is 00h, the user pressed a key with an extended keycode, which will be returned by the next call of this function

 this function reads from standard input, which is always the keyboard under DOS 1.x, but may be redirected under DOS 2+

 although the return of AL=00h when no characters are available is not documented, some programs rely on this behavior
