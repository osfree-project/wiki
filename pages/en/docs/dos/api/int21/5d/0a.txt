====== Int 21H, AH=5DH, AL=0AH ======

===== Version =====

3.1 and higher

===== Brief =====

SET EXTENDED ERROR INFORMATION

===== Family API =====


===== Input =====

	AX = 5D0Ah
	DS:DX -> 11-word DOS parameter list (see #01686)

===== Return =====

nothing.  next call to AH=59h will return values from fields AX,BX,CX,DX,DI, and ES in corresponding registers

===== Macro =====


===== Notes =====

documented for DOS 5+, but undocumented in earlier versions

the MS-DOS Programmer's Reference incorrectly states that this call was introduced in DOS 4, and fails to mention that the ERROR structure passed to this function is a DOS parameter list.

BUGS:DR DOS 3.41 and 5.0 read the value for ES from the DS field of the DPL; fortunately, MS-DOS ignores the DS field, allowing a generic routine which sets both DS and ES fields to the same value

Novell DOS 7 (through at least Update 4) does not save the pointer, which is always reported as 0000h:0000h by AH=59h; Update 15 fully supports this function
