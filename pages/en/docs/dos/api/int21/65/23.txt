====== Int 21H, AH=65H, AL=23H ======

===== Version =====

4.0 and higher

===== Brief =====

DETERMINE IF CHARACTER REPRESENTS YES/NO RESPONSE

===== Family API =====


===== Input =====

  AX = 6523h
  DL = character
  DH = second character of double-byte character (if applicable)

  
===== Return =====

   CF set on error
  CF clear if successful
  AX = type
  00h no
  01h yes
  02h neither yes nor no
  
===== Macro =====


===== Notes =====

  Supported by Novell DOS 7, though prior to Update 14, the results depended on the kernel variant rather than the YESCHAR= or COUNTRY= setting in CONFIG.SYS

  BUG: Novell DOS commands and tools all use internal settings rather than this function, so the Yes/No responses are dependent on the specific country's variant being run rather than on the COUNTRY= setting
