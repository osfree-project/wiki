====== Int 21H, AH=5FH, AL=02H ======

===== Version =====

===== Brief =====

GET REDIRECTION LIST ENTRY

===== Family API =====


===== Input =====

    AX = 5F02h
   BX = zero-based redirection list index
   CX = driver signature
     0000h LANtastic
     4E57h ('NW') NetWare
   DS:SI -> 16-byte buffer for ASCIZ local device name or drive letter followed by colon
   ES:DI -> 128-byte buffer for ASCIZ network name

===== Return =====

  CF clear if successful
  BH = device status
    00h valid
    01h invalid
    02h valid (connected from inside Windows for Workgroups v3.11)
  BL = device type
    03h printer
    04h disk drive
  CX = user data previously set with AX=5F03h
  DS:SI and ES:DI buffers filled
  DX,BP destroyed
  CF set on error
    AX = error code (01h,12h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)

===== Macro =====


===== Notes =====

 This function is passed through to INT 2F/AX=111Eh by the DOS kernel. Error code 12h is returned if BX is greater than the size of the list. Also supported by Banyan VINES, PC-NFS, LANtastic, and 10NET. Supported by LapLink RemoteAccess but returns the local drive letter; the remote drive letter can be obtained with INT 2F/AX=Cxxxh (see INT 2F/AX=C000h"LapLink"). The returned device name may or may not include a colon, depending on the network software
