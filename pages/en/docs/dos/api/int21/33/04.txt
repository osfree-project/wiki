===== Version =====

===== Brief =====

SET CPSW STATE

===== Family API =====


===== Input =====

        AX = 3304h
        DL = new CPSW state

===== Return =====

nothing

===== Macro =====


===== Notes =====

this function and AX=3303h were intended to support a proposed code-page switching flag (using the WORD at offset 0Ch in the DOS directory entry for codepage information); however, this function has always been a NOP in public releases of DOS and OS/2. See _DOS_Internals_ Chapter 2 for more information.
          
the released MS-DOS 4.00 IO.SYS has an undocumented CONFIG.SYS directive named CPSW= and that beside others the MS-DOS 4.00 ATTRIB supported a number of undocumented special parameters for "predefined" Extended Attributes (EAs) e.g. ATTRIB filename [(CODEPAGE|CP)[=new_value]].

this function does not use any of the DOS-internal stacks and may thus be called at any time. It is directly dispatched from the INT 21h entry point with interrupts disabled.
