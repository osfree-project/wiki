====== Int 21H, AH=33H, AL=03H ======

===== Version =====

3.4/4.0

===== Brief =====

GET CURRENT CPSW STATE

===== Family API =====


===== Input =====

        AX = 3303h

===== Return =====

 DL = current CPSW

===== Macro =====


===== Notes =====

  this function and AX=3304h were intended to support a proposed
          code-page switching flag (using the WORD at offset 0Ch in the DOS
          directory entry for codepage information); however, this function
          has always been a NOP in public releases of DOS and OS/2.
          See _DOS_Internals_ Chapter 2 for more information.
        the released MS-DOS 4.00 IO.SYS has an undocumented CONFIG.SYS
          directive named CPSW= and that beside others the MS-DOS 4.00 ATTRIB
          supported a number of undocumented special parameters for
          "predefined" Extended Attributes (EAs) e.g.
          ATTRIB filename [(CODEPAGE|CP)[=new_value]].
        this function does not use any of the DOS-internal stacks and may
           thus be called at any time. It is directly dispatched from
           the INT 21h entry point with interrupts disabled.
