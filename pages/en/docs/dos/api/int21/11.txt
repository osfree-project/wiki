FIND FIRST MATCHING FILE USING FCB

===== Family API =====

[[en:docs:fapi:DosFindFirst]]

===== Input =====

        AH = 11h
        DS:DX -> unopened FCB (see #01345), may contain '?' wildcards

===== Return =====

  AL = status
            00h successful
                [DTA] unopened FCB for first matching file
            FFh no matching filename, or bad FCB

===== Notes =====

 the type of the returned FCB depends on whether the input FCB was a
          normal or an extended FCB
        the data returned in the DTA (disk transfer area) is actually the
          drive number (or extended FCB header and drive number) followed by
          the file's directory entry (see #01352); this format happens to be
          compatible with an unopened FCB
        for extended FCBs with search attribute 08h, the volume label (if any)
          will be returned even if the current directory is not the root dir.
        DOS 3.0+ also allows the '*' wildcard
        the search FCB at DS:DX must not be modified if AH=12h will be used to
          continue searching; DOS 3.3 has set the following parts of the FCB:
                 0Ch    BYTE    ???
                 0Dh    WORD    directory entry number of matching file
                 0Fh    WORD    cluster number of current directory
                 11h  4 BYTEs   ???
                 15h    BYTE    drive number (1=A:)
        this function is used by many copy protection schemes to obtain the
          starting cluster of a file
BUG:    under Windows95, if a .EXE program ("MZ" header) rather than a true
          .COM calls this function from a DOS box, the ten bytes of the
          directory entry from 0Ch to 15h may be filled with zeros rather than
          the additional file times

Format of DOS directory entry:
Offset  Size    Description     (Table 01352)
 00h  8 BYTEs   blank-padded filename
                first character is set to E5h for deleted files (05h for
                  pending delete files under Novell DOS / OpenDOS)
 08h  3 BYTEs   blank-padded file extension
 0Bh    BYTE    attributes
 0Ch 10 BYTEs   (MS-DOS 1.0-6.22) reserved
                (DR DOS) used to store file password / owner (see #01354)
                        (see also INT 21/AX=4302h)
                (Novell DOS 7) DELWATCH data (see #01354)
                (MS-DOS 7/Windows95) additional file times (see #01353)
 16h    WORD    time of creation or last update (see #01665 at AX=5700h)
 18h    WORD    date of creation or last update (see #01666 at AX=5700h)
 1Ah    WORD    starting cluster number (see also AX=440Dh/CX=0871h)
                (may not be set in INT 21/AH=11h return data for FAT32 drives)
 1Ch    DWORD   file size
SeeAlso: #01355,#02628,#02629

Format of MS-DOS 7/Windows95 additional file times:
Offset  Size    Description     (Table 01353)
 00h    BYTE    reserved
 01h    BYTE    10-millisecond units past creation time below
 02h    WORD    file creation time
 04h    WORD    file creation date
 06h    WORD    last-access date
 08h    WORD    (FAT32) high word of starting cluster number
Note:   this data is stored beginning at offset 0Ch in a standard directory
          entry
SeeAlso: #01352

Format of DR DOS 6/Novell DOS 7 additional file information:
Offset  Size    Description     (Table 01354)
 0Ch    BYTE    reserved (00h)
                (DOSPLUS v1.2) user-defined attributes for CP/M compatibility
                  (bit 7 = F1,...,bit 4 = F4, bits 3-0 reserved (0))
 0Dh    BYTE    first character of original filename for deleted file
 0Eh    WORD    encrypted file/directory password
 10h    WORD    reserved (00h)
                (Novell DOS 7 DELWATCH) original file time
                    cleared when file is undeleted or purged
 12h    WORD    (DR DOS 6) file owner ID
                (Novell DOS 7 DELWATCH) original file date
                    cleared when file is undeleted or purged
 14h    WORD    single/multiuser file/directory access rights (see AX=4302h)
---deleted files---
 16h    WORD    (Novell DOS 7 DELWATCH) time of deletion
 18h    WORD    (Novell DOS 7 DELWATCH) date of deletion
Note:   offsets are within the full directory entry
SeeAlso: #01352

Format of MS-DOS 7/Windows95 long-filename directory entry:
Offset  Size    Description     (Table 01355)
 00h    BYTE    LFN record sequence and flags
                bits 5-0: sequence number
                bit 6: set if last long-filename record for file
                bit 7: set if file deleted
 01h 10 BYTEs   long filename, first part
 0Bh    BYTE    0Fh (otherwise impossible file attribute, used as signature)
 0Ch    BYTE    reserved??? (00h)
 0Dh    BYTE    checksum for short filename
 0Eh 12 BYTEs   long filename, second part
 1Ah    WORD    first cluster number (always 0000h for LFN records)
 1Ch  4 BYTEs   long filename, third part
Notes:  long-filename entries are always stored in the directory just prior
          to the short-name entry for a file
        multiple LFN records are used if the long filename does not fit into
          a single record
        the short-filename checksum byte is computed by adding up the
          eleven bytes of the short filename, rotating the intermediate
          sum right one bit before adding the next character
        the long filename is encoded as 16-bit Unicode characters; for most
          filenames, this appears in the directory as the ASCII character
          followed by 00h
