====== Int 21H, AH=02H ======

===== Version =====

1 and higher

===== Brief =====

WRITE CHARACTER TO STANDARD OUTPUT

===== Family API =====

[[en:docs:fapi:DosWrite]]

===== Input =====

  AH = 02h
  DL = character to write

===== Return =====

  AL = last character output (despite the official docs which state nothing is returned) (at least DOS 2.1-7.0)

===== Notes =====

 ^C/^Break are checked, and INT 23 executed if pressed standard output is always the screen under DOS 1.x, but may be redirected under DOS 2+

 the last character output will be the character in DL unless DL=09h on entry, in which case AL=20h as tabs are expanded to blanks

 if standard output is redirected to a file, no error checks (write-protected, full media, etc.) are performed
