===== Brief =====

CREATE TEMPORARY FILE

===== Family API =====


===== Input =====

	AH = 5Ah
	CX = file attribute (see #01420 at AX=4301h)
	DS:DX -> ASCIZ path ending with a '\' + 13 zero bytes to receive the
		generated filename

===== Return =====

  CF clear if successful
	    AX = file handle opened for read/write in compatibility mode
	    DS:DX pathname extended with generated name for temporary file
	CF set on error
	    AX = error code (03h,04h,05h) (see #01680)

===== Notes =====

Desc:	creates a file with a unique name which must be explicitly deleted
Notes:	under the FlashTek X-32 DOS extender, the path pointer is in DS:EDX
	MS-DOS 3.0-4.0 and DR DOS 3.4-5.0 generate the filename as a sequence
	  of hex digits based on the current date and time; MS-DOS 6+,
	  DR DOS 6, and Novell DOS 7 use letters A-P in place of hex digits
	MS-DOS 5.0 and DR DOS 3.41/5.0 will insert a missing trailing backslash
	  before appending the generated filename, but due to this, an empty
	  string results in a file in the root directory
BUGS:	COMPAQ DOS 3.31 hangs if the pathname is at XXXXh:0000h; it apparently
	  wraps around to the end of the segment
	MS-DOS 5.00 revisions A and B and PC-DOS 5.00 revision A reportedly
	  hang the system if the specified path is the root directory and the
	  root directory is full (no free directory entries)
	Mark Incley <mincley@krisalis.demon.co.uk> reports that this function
	  hangs in MS-DOS 6.2x if the name includes two consecutive path
	  separators (e.g. C:\\ )
