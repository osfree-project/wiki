====== Int 21H, AH=13H ======

===== Version =====

1 and higher

===== Brief =====

DELETE FILE USING FCB

===== Family API =====

[[en:docs:fapi:DosDelete]]

===== Input =====

        AH = 13h
        DS:DX -> unopened FCB (see #01345), filename filled with template for
                deletion ('?' wildcards allowed)

===== Return =====

Return: AL = status
            00h one or more files successfully deleted
            FFh no matching files or all were read-only or locked

===== Notes =====

  DOS 1.25+ deletes everything in the current directory (including
          subdirectories) and sets the first byte of the name to 00h (entry
          never used) instead of E5h if called on an extended FCB with
          filename '???????????' and bits 0-4 of the attribute set (bits 1 and
          2 for DOS 1.x).  This may have originally been an optimization to
          minimize directory searching after a mass deletion (DOS 1.25+ stop
          the directory search upon encountering a never-used entry), but can
          corrupt the filesystem under DOS 2+ because subdirectories are
          removed without deleting the files they contain.
        currently-open files should not be deleted
        MS-DOS allows deletion of read-only files with an extended FCB, whereas
          Novell NetWare, DR DOS 6, and Novell DOS 7/OpenDOS 7.01 do not
        this function generates a trap "D" under OS/2 v4.x (Warp4) when called
          on an HPFS partition with a wildcard in the filename; it operates
          correctly on FAT partitions and when called without wildcards
