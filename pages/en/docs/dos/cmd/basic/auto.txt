====== AUTO ======

===== Syntax =====

<code basic>
AUTO [start [, increment]]
</code>

===== Description =====

Automatic line numbering for manual program entry.  If the line already exists, then an
asterisk is displayed and pressing ENTER leaves the line as-is.  If the line does not
exist, then an asterisk is not displayed and pressing ENTER terminates AUTO mode. 
Regardless whether the line exists, entering the command MAN will terminate AUTO mode. 
AUTO mode is also terminated by any ERROR or by pressing control-C.
