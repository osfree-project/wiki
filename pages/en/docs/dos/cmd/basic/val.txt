====== VAL ======

===== Syntax =====

<code basic>
N  = VAL( A$ )
</code>

===== Parameters =====

A$ is a string, LEN >= 1

===== Description =====

The value of the numeric-constant associated with A$, if the string associated with A$ is
a numeric-constant.  Leading and trailing spaces in the string are ignored.  If the
evaluation of the numeric-constant would result in a value which causes an underflow,
then the value returned shall be zero.  For example, VAL( " 123.5 " ) = 123.5, VAL(
"2.E-99" ) could be zero, and VAL( "MCMXVII" ) causes an exception.
