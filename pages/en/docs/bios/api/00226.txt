Notes

  * Some implementations of Remote (Initial) Program Loader (RPL/RIPL) don't set bit 0 to indicate a "virtual" floppy drive, although the RPL requires access to its memory image through a faked drive A:. This may have caused problems with releases of DOS 3.3x and earlier,  which assumed A: and B: to be invalid drives then and would discard  any attempts to access these drives. Implementations of RPL should set bit 0 to indicate a "virtual" floppy.
  * The IBM PC DOS 3.3x-2000 IBMBIO.COM contains two occurrences of code sequences like:

	    INT 11h
	    JMP SHORT skip
	    DB 52h,50h,53h; "RPS"
	    skip: OR AX,1
	    TEST AX,1

While at the first glance this seems to be a bug since it just wastes memory and the condition is always true, this could well be a signature for an applyable patch to stop it from forcing AX bit 0 to be always on. MS-DOS IO.SYS does not contain these signatures, however.

BUGs

  * Some old BIOSes didn't properly report the count of floppy drives installed to the system.  In newer systems INT 13h/AH=15h can be used to retrieve the number of floppy drives installed.
  * Award BIOS v4.50G and v4.51PG erroneously set bit 0 even if there are no floppy drives installed; use two calls to INT 13/AH=15h to determine whether any floppies are actually installed
