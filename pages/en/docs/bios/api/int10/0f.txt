===== osFree Macro Library =====

[[en:docs:macrolib:@GetMode]]/[[en:docs:macrolib:@VideoState]]

===== Family API =====

[[en:docs:fapi:VioGetMode]]

===== Parameters =====

  * AH = 0Fh

===== Return =====

  * AH = number of character columns
  * AL = display mode (see #00010 at AH=00h)
  * BH = active page (see AH=05h)

===== Macro =====

<code asm>
INCLUDE BIOS.INC

@GetMode
@VideoState

</code>

===== Notes =====

  * if mode was set with bit 7 set ("no blanking"), the returned mode will also have bit 7 set
  * EGA, VGA, and UltraVision return either AL=03h (color) or AL=07h (monochrome) in all extended-row text modes
  * HP 200LX returns AL=07h (monochrome) if mode was set to AL=21h and always 80 resp. 40 columns in all text modes regardless of current zoom setting (see AH=D0h)
  * when using a Hercules Graphics Card, additional checks are necessary:
    * mode 05h: if WORD 0040h:0063h is 03B4h, may be in graphics page 1 (as set by DOSSHELL and other Microsoft software)
    * mode 06h: if WORD 0040h:0063h is 03B4h, may be in graphics page 0 (as set by DOSSHELL and other Microsoft software)
    * mode 07h: if BYTE 0040h:0065h bit 1 is set, Hercules card is in graphics mode, with bit 7 indicating the page (mode set by Hercules driver for Borland Turbo C)
  * the Tandy 2000 BIOS is only documented as returning AL, not AH or BH
