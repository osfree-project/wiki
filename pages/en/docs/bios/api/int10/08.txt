===== Notes =====

  * for monochrome displays, a foreground of 1 with background 0 is underlined
  * the blink bit may be reprogrammed to enable intense background colors using AX=1003h or by programming the CRT controller
  * the foreground intensity bit (3) can be programmed to switch between character sets A and B on EGA and VGA cards, thus enabling 512 simultaneous characters on screen.  In this case the bit's usual function (intensity) is regularly turned off.
  * in graphics modes, only characters drawn with white foreground pixels are matched by the pattern-comparison routine
  * on the Tandy 2000, BH=FFh specifies that the current page should be used
  * because of the IBM BIOS specifications, there may exist some clone BIOSes which do not preserve SI or DI; the Novell DOS kernel preserves SI, DI, and BP before many INT 10h calls to avoid problems due to those registers not being preserved by the BIOS.
  * some IBM PC ROM BIOSes destroy BP when in graphics modes
