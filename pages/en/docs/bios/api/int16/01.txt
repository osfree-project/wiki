====== Int 16H, AH=01H ======

===== Version =====

IBM 5150 and higher

===== Brief =====

Peek char from keyboard buffer

===== Family API =====

[[en:docs:fapi:KbdPeek]]

===== Input =====

  * AH = 01h

===== Return =====

  * ZF set if no keystroke available
  * ZF clear if keystroke available
    * AH = BIOS scan code
    * AL = ASCII character

===== Macro =====

<code asm>
INCLUDE BIOS.INC

@CharPeek
</code>

===== Notes =====

  * if a keystroke is present, it is not removed from the keyboard buffer; however, any extended keystrokes which are not compatible with 83/84-key keyboards are removed by IBM and most fully-compatible BIOSes in the process of checking whether a non-extended keystroke is available
  * some (older) clone BIOSes do not discard extended keystrokes and manage function AH=00h and AH=10h the same
  * the K3PLUS v6.00+ INT 16 BIOS replacement doesn't discard extended keystrokes (same as with functions 10h and 20h), but will always translate prefix E0h to 00h. This allows old programs to use extended keystrokes and should not cause compatibility problems
