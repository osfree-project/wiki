====== Int 13H, AH=05H ======

===== Version =====

IBM 5150 and higher

===== Brief =====

Format Track

===== Family API =====

none

===== Input =====

  * AH = 05h
  * AL = number of sectors to format
  * CH = track number
  * DH = head number
  * DL = drive number
  * ES:BX -> address field buffer (see #00235)

===== Return =====

  * CF set on error
  * CF clear if successful
  * AH = status (see #00234)

===== Macro =====

<code asm>
INCLUDE BIOS.INC

@DskFormat  0, 0, 0, offset buf
</code>

===== Notes =====

  * on AT or higher, call AH=17h first
  * the number of sectors per track is read from the diskette parameter table pointed at by INT 1E
  * some old Compaq BIOSes have a bug when attempting to call this function from Windows Standard Mode with EMM386 loaded.  A possible workaround is to call this function from Real Mode e.g. through DPMI function "Call Real Mode function with FAR return" (see INT 31/AX=0301h).
