====== Int 31H, AH=01H, AL=01H ======

===== Version =====

0.9

===== Brief =====

Free DOS Memory Block

===== Input =====

  AX = 0101H
  DX = selector of block to be freed
        
===== Return =====

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  0007H	memory control blocks damaged (also returned by DPMI 0.9 hosts).
  0009H	incorrect memory segment specified (also returned by DPMI 0.9 hosts).
  8022H	invalid selector

===== Notes =====

Frees a memory block that was previously allocated with the Allocate DOS Memory Block function (Int 31H Function 0100H).

All descriptors allocated for the memory block are automatically freed by this function, and are no longer valid after this function returns.

Under DPMI 1.0 hosts, any segment registers which contain a selector being freed are zeroed by this function.

Refer to the rules for descriptor usage in Appendix D.
