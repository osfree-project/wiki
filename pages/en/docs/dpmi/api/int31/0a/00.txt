====== Int 31H, AH=0AH, AL=00H ======

===== Version =====

0.9

===== Brief =====

Get Vendor-Specific API Entry Point

===== Input =====

  AX = 0A00H
  DS:(E)SI = selector:offset of ASCIIZ (null-terminated) string which identifies the DPMI host vendor
    
===== Return =====

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  ES:(E)DI = selector:offset of extended API entry point
  and DS, FS, GS, EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, and EBP may be modified.
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  8001H	unsupported function (extension not found)

===== Notes =====

Returns an address which can be called to use host-specific extensions to the standard set of DPMI functions. DPMI 1.0 clients should avoid use of this function.

The null-terminated string specifies the host-specific vendor name or some other unique identifier to obtain a specific extension entry point. The string comparison used to look up the API entry point is case-sensitive.

Clients must use a FAR CALL to reach the extended API entry point.

All extended API parameters are specified by the vendor.

DPMI 1.0 clients should use Int 2FH Function 168AH in preference to this function. DPMI 1.0 hosts support this function solely for backward compatibility with DPMI 0.9 clients.
