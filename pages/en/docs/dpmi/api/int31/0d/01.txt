====== Int 31H, AH=0DH, AL=01H ======

===== Version =====

1.0

===== Brief =====

Free Shared Memory

===== Input =====

  AX = 0D01H
  SI:DI = handle of shared memory block to free
    
===== Return =====

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  8023H	invalid handle

===== Notes =====

Deallocates a shared memory block.

The shared memory handle becomes invalid after the shared memory block is deallocated, and should not be used in any other function call (such as serialization).

The host maintains virtual machine use counts and a global use count for each shared memory block. A virtual machine use count is the number of allocation calls (Int 31H Function 0D00H) that have been issued by a particular virtual machine for the shared block, while the global use count corresponds to the number of virtual machines which have access to the block. When a virtual machine use count reaches zero, the clients in that virtual machine no longer have addressability to the shared memory block; when the global use count reaches zero, the shared memory block is destroyed by the host.

It is the client's responsibility to free any descriptors that it has allocated to map the shared memory block.

Applications should not depend on this function to release a previous successful serialization for the same shared memory block. Serialization is only released by this function when the virtual machine use count goes to 0 (i.e., the client no longer has access to the shared memory block).
