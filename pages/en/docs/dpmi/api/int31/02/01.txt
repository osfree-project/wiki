====== Int 31H, AH=02H, AL=01H ======

===== Version =====

0.9

===== Brief =====

Set Real Mode Interrupt Vector

===== Input =====

  AX = 0201H
  BL = interrupt number
  CX:DX = segment:offset of real mode interrupt handler
        
===== Return =====

 Carry flag = clear (this function always succeeds)

===== Notes =====

The address passed in CX must be a real mode segment address, not a selector. Consequently, the interrupt handler must either reside in DOS memory (i.e. below the 1 MB boundary) or the client must allocate a real mode callback address. See Int 31H Functions 0100H and 0303H.

If the interrupt being hooked is a hardware interrupt, the memory that the interrupt handler uses must be locked.
