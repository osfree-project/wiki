====== Int 31H, AH=02H, AL=02H ======

===== Version =====

0.9

===== Brief =====

Get Processor Exception Handler Vector

===== Input =====

  AX = 0202H
  BL = exception number (00H-1FH)
        
===== Return =====

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  CX:(E)DX = selector:offset of exception handler
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  8021H	invalid value (BL not in range 0-1FH)

===== Notes =====

Returns the address of the current client's protected mode exception handler for the specified exception number. This function should be avoided by DPMI 1.0 clients.

The value returned in CX is a valid protected mode selector, not a real mode segment address.

32-bit clients will be returned a 32-bit offset in the EDX register.

Clients which run under DPMI 1.0 should use Int 31H Functions 0210H and 0211H to obtain the addresses of exception handlers. This function is supported by DPMI 1.0 hosts solely for compatibility with DPMI 0.9.
