Get Real Mode Interrupt Vector

===== Input =====

  AX = 0200H
  BL = interrupt number
        
===== Return =====

  Carry flag = clear (this function always succeeds)
  CX:DX = segment:offset of real mode interrupt handler

===== Notes =====

Returns the contents of the current virtual machine's real mode interrupt vector for the specified interrupt.

The value returned in CX is a real mode segment address, not a selector. Attempts to place this value into a segment register in protected mode may cause a general protection (GP) fault.

All 100H (256) real mode interrupt vectors must be made available through this function by the DPMI host.
