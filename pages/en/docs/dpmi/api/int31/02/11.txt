===== Brief =====

Get Extended Processor Exception Handler Vector (Real Mode)

===== Input =====

  AX = 0211H
  BL = exception number (00H-1FH)
        
===== Return =====

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  CX:(E)DX = selector:offset of exception handler
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  8021H	invalid value (BL not in range 00H-1FH)

===== Notes =====

CX:(E)DX does not specify a real-mode segment:offset. The reason is that this function allows a client to get the address of the exception handler which will receive control in protected mode when the specified exception occurs in real mode (i.e. the host will provide an implied mode switch for the purposes of servicing the exception, then return to real mode after the handler exits).

Real mode exceptions are sent to the primary client of the virtual machine.
