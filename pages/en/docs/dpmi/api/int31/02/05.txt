====== Int 31H, AH=02H, AL=05H ======

===== Version =====

0.9

===== Brief =====

Set Protected Mode Interrupt Vector

===== Input =====

  AX = 0205H
  BL = interrupt number
  CX:(E)DX = selector:offset of exception handler
        
===== Return =====

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  8022H	invalid selector

===== Notes =====

Sets the address of protected mode handler for the specified interrupt into the interrupt vector.

The value passed in CX should be a valid protected mode code selector, not a real mode segment address.

32-bit clients must supply a 32-bit offset in the EDX register. If the client's handler chains to the next exception handler it must do so using a 32-bit interrupt stack frame.

DPMI hosts must support all 100H (256 decimal) interrupt vectors with this function.

Hardware interrupts are sent to the primary client of the virtual machine while software interrupts are sent to the current client. (See Appendix A: Glossary for definitions of primary and current client.)

Refer to the rules for descriptor usage in Appendix D.
