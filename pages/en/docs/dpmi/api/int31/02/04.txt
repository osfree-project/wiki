Get Protected Mode Interrupt Vector

===== Input =====

  AX = 0204H
  BL = interrupt number
        
===== Return =====

  Carry flag = clear (this function always succeeds)
  CX:(E)DX = selector:offset of exception handler

===== Notes =====

Returns the address of the current protected mode interrupt handler for the specified interrupt.

The value returned in CX is a valid protected mode selector, not a real mode segment address.

32-bit clients will be returned a 32-bit offset in the EDX register.

DPMI hosts must make all 100H (256) interrupt vectors available through this function.
