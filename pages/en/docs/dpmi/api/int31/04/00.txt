Get Version

===== Input =====

  AX = 0400H

===== Return =====

  Carry flag = clear (this function always succeeds)
  AH = DPMI major version as a binary number
  AL = DPMI minor version as a binary number
  BX = flags

^ Bits ^ Significance ^
| 0 | 0 = host is 16-bit DPMI implementation 1 = host is 32-bit (80386) DPMI implementation |
| 1 | 0 = CPU returned to Virtual 86 mode for reflected interrupts 1 = CPU returned to real mode for reflected interrupts |
| 2 | 0 = virtual memory not supported 1 = virtual memory supported |
| 3 | reserved, for historical reasons |
| 4-15 | reserved for later use |

  CL = processor type

^ Value ^ Significance ^
| 02H | 80286 |
| 03H | 80386 |
| 04H | 80486 |
| 05H-FFH | reserved for future Intel processors |

  DH = current value of virtual master PIC base interrupt
  DL = current value of virtual slave PIC base interrupt

===== Notes =====

Returns the version number of the DPMI Specification implemented by the DPMI host. Clients can use this information to determine which function calls are supported in the current environment.

Under DPMI hosts, the major version number is returned in AH and the minor version number is returned in AL. There are two decimal digits for the minor version number with the least-significant digit representing the revision number of the minor version number. Under DPMI version 0.9 hosts, AH is returned as 0, and AL is returned as decimal 90 (5AH). In hypothetical DPMI version 2.3, AH would be returned as 2 and AL would be returned as 30 (1EH).
