===== Version =====

0.9

===== Brief =====

Set Debug Watchpoint

===== Input =====

  AX = 0B00H
  BX:CX = linear address of watchpoint
  DL = size of watchpoint (1, 2, or 4 bytes)
  DH = type of watchpoint

^ Value ^ Breakpoint Type ^
| 0 | execute |
| 1 | write |
| 2 | read/write |

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  BX = watchpoint handle
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  8016H	too many breakpoints
  8021H	invalid value (in DL or DH)
  8025H	invalid linear address (linear address not mapped or alignment error)
===== Notes =====

Sets a debug watchpoint at the specified linear address.

Under DPMI 1.0, the handle will be in the range 0-14. Under DPMI 0.9, the handle range is not limited.

The watchpoint handle corresponds to the bit number in the Virtual DR6 returned in the exception frame (see Int 31H Function 0212H and page 18 of the DPMI spec).
