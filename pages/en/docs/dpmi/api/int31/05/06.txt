====== Int 31H, AH=05H, AL=06H ======

===== Version =====

1.0

===== Brief =====

Get Page Attributes

===== Input =====

  AX = 0506H
  ESI = memory block handle
  EBX = base offset in memory block of page (or of first page, if requesting attributes for multiple pages)
  ECX = number of pages
  ES:EDX = selector:offset of a buffer to receive page attributes, 1 word (16-bits) per page (see Note)
    
===== Return =====

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  and buffer at ES:EDX filled in with page attributes (see Note)
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  8001H	unsupported function (16-bit host)
  8023H	invalid handle (in ESI)
  8025H	invalid linear address (Specified range is not within specified block)

===== Notes =====

Returns the attributes of one or more pages within a linear memory block previously allocated with Int 31H Function 0504H.

A DPMI 1.0 host that is 16-bit only will not support this function.

A 16-bit client of a 32-bit DPMI 1.0 host can use this function.

If EBX is not aligned, it will be rounded down to the next lower page boundary.

The specified buffer is filled in by the DPMI host with the attributes of the requested pages, 1 word (16-bits) per page, in the following format:

^ Bits ^ Significance ^^
| 0-2 | page type (0-7) ||
| ::: | Value | Meaning |
| ::: | 0 | uncommitted page |
| ::: | 1 | committed page |
| ::: | 2 | mapped page |
| ::: | 3-7 |currently unused |
| 3 | 0 = page is read-only 1 = page is read/write ||
| 4 | 0 = accessed/dirty bits not available for this page 1 = accessed/dirty bits are supplied for this page in bits 5-6 ||
| 5 | 0 = page has not been accessed (if bit 4=1)  1 = page has been accessed (if bit 4=1) ||
| 6 | 0 = page has not been modified (if bit 4=1)  1 = page has been modified (if bit 4=1) ||
| 7-15 | reserved, currently zero ||

Mapped pages can only occur in memory blocks under DPMI hosts that support the Device Mapping capability or the Conventional Memory Mapping capability. See Int 31H Functions 0401H, 0508H, and 0509H.

The dirty and accessed bits are only supplied if the DPMI host supports the Page Accessed/Dirty capability. DPMI hosts that support this capability are required to return dirty and accessed bits for all committed pages and for mapped pages created with the Map Conventional Memory call (Int 31H Function 0509H). However, dirty and accessed bits may not be returned for individual mapped pages created with the Map Device call (Int 31H Function 0508H) if the host is using page table entries (PTEs) to virtualize the device.
