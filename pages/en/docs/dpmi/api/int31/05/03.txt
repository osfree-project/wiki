====== Int 31H, AH=05H, AL=03H ======

===== Version =====

0.9

===== Brief =====

Resize Memory Block

===== Input =====

  AX = 0503H
  BX:CX = new size of block (bytes, must be nonzero)
  SI:DI = memory block handle

===== Return =====

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  BX:CX = new linear address of memory block
  SI:DI = new handle for memory block
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  8012H	linear memory unavailable
  8013H	physical memory unavailable
  8014H	backing store unavailable
  8016H	handle unavailable
  8021H	invalid value (BX:CX = 0)
  8023H	invalid handle (in SI:DI)


===== Notes =====

Changes the size of a memory block that was previously allocated with either the Allocate Memory Block function (Int 31H Function 0501H) or the Allocate Linear Memory Block function (Int 31H Function 0504H).

After this function returns, the previous handle for the memory block is invalid and should not be used.

When increasing the size of a block, this function always creates committed pages. When decreasing the block size, this call will correctly free all possible page types (committed pages, uncommitted pages, and mapped pages). The linear address and handle of the memory block may change as a result of this call.

It is the client's responsibility to update any descriptors that map the memory block with the new linear address after resizing the block.

This function returns an error if the client attempts to resize a memory block to zero bytes.
