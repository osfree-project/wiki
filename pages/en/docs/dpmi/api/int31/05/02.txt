===== Version =====

0.9

===== Brief =====

Free Memory Block

===== Input =====

  AX = 0502H
  SI:DI = memory block handle

===== Return =====

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  8023H	invalid handle

===== Notes =====

This call will correctly free all of the possible page types that can occur in a memory block: committed pages, uncommitted pages, and mapped pages (see Appendix A: Glossary).

No descriptors are freed by this call. It is the client's responsibility to free any descriptors that it previously allocated to map the memory block. Descriptors should be freed before linear memory blocks.
