====== Int 31H, AH=09H, AL=02H ======

===== Version =====

0.9

===== Brief =====

Get Virtual Interrupt State

===== Input =====

  AX = 0902H
    
===== Return =====

  Carry flag = clear (this function always succeeds)
  AL = 0 if virtual interrupts are disabled
  AL = 1 if virtual interrupts are enabled

===== Notes =====

This function should be used in preference to the PUSHF instruction to examine the interrupt flag, because the PUSHF instruction returns the physical interrupt flag rather than the virtualized (per-client) interrupt flag. On some DPMI hosts, the physical interrupt flag will always be enabled, even when hardware interrupts are not being passed through to the client.
