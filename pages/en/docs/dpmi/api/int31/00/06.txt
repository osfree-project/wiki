Get Segment Base Address

===== Input =====

  AX = 0006H
  BX = selector

===== Return =====

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  CX:DX = 32-bit linear base address of segment
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  8022H	invalid selector
  
===== Notes =====

Returns the 32-bit linear base address from the LDT descriptor for the specified segment.

Client programs must use the LSL instruction to query the limit for a descriptor. Note that on 80386 machines, the client must use the 32-bit form of LSL if the segment size is greater than 64 KB.

Refer to the rules for descriptor usage in Appendix D.
