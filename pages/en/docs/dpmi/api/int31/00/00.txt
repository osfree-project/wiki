====== Int 31H, AH=00H, AL=00H ======

===== Version =====

0.9

===== Brief =====

Allocate LDT Descriptors

===== Input =====

  AX = 0000H
  CX = number of descriptors to allocate

===== Return =====

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  AX = base selector
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  8011H	descriptor unavailable
  
===== Notes =====

Allocates one or more descriptors in the task's Local Descriptor Table (LDT). The descriptor(s) allocated must be initialized by the application with other function calls.

If more than one descriptor was requested, the function returns a base selector referencing the first of a contiguous array of descriptors. The selector values for subsequent descriptors in the array can be calculated by adding the value returned by Int 31H Function 0003H.

The allocated descriptor(s) will be set to "data" with the present bit set and a base and limit of zero. The privilege level of the descriptor(s) will match the application's code segment privilege level.

Refer to the rules for descriptor usage in Appendix D.
