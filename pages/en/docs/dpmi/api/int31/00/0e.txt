====== Int 31H, AH=00H, AL=0EH ======

===== Version =====

1.0

===== Brief =====

Get Multiple Descriptors

===== Input =====

  AX = 000EH
  CX = number of descriptors to copy
  ES:(E)DI = selector:offset of a buffer in the following format:

^ Offset ^ Length ^ Contents ^
|  00H | 2 | Selector #1 (set by client) |
|  02H | 8 | Descriptor #1 (returned by host) |
|  0AH | 2 | Selector #2 (set by client) |
|  0CH | 8 | Descriptor #2 (returned byhost) |
|  ... | ... | ... |
    
===== Return =====

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  and buffer contains copies of the descriptors for the specified selectors
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  8022H	invalid selector
  CX = number of descriptors successfully copied

===== Notes =====

Copies one or more local descriptor table (LDT) entries into a client buffer.

If an error occurs because of an invalid selector or descriptor, the function returns the number of descriptors which were successfully copied in CX. All of the descriptors which were copied prior to the one that failed are valid.

32-bit programs must use ES:EDI to point to the buffer. 16-bit programs should use ES:DI.

Refer to the rules for descriptor usage in Appendix D.
