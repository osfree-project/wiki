====== Int 31H, AH=00H, AL=0AH ======

===== Version =====

0.9

===== Brief =====

Create Alias Descriptor

===== Input =====

  AX = 000AH
  BX = selector

===== Return =====

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  AX = data selector (alias)
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  8011H	descriptor unavailable
  8022H	invalid selector

===== Notes =====

Creates a new LDT data descriptor that has the same base and limit as the specified descriptor.

The selector supplied to the function may be either a data selector or an executable selector. Note that the published 0.9 specification was in error to say that the function generates an error on a data descriptor.

The descriptor alias returned by this function will not track changes to the original descriptor. In other words, if an alias is created with this function, and the base or limit of the original segment is then changed, the two descriptors will no longer map the same memory.

Refer to the rules for descriptor usage in Appendix D.
