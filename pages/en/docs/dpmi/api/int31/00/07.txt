====== Int 31H, AH=00H, AL=07H ======

===== Version =====

0.9

===== Brief =====

Set Segment Base Address

===== Input =====

  AX = 0007H
  BX = selector
  CX:DX = 32-bit linear base address of segment

===== Return =====

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  8022H	invalid selector
  8025H	invalid linear address (changing the base would cause the descriptor to reference a linear address range outside that allowed for DPMI clients)
  
===== Notes =====

Sets the 32-bit linear base address field in the LDT descriptor for the specified segment.

A DPMI 1.0 host will automatically reload any segment register which contains the selector specified in register BX. It is suggested that DPMI 0.9 hosts also implement this.

Refer to the rules for descriptor usage in Appendix D.
