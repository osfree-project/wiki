===== Brief =====

Mark Page as Demand Paging Candidate

===== Input =====

  AX = 0702H
  BX:CX = starting linear address of pages to mark as paging candidates
  SI:DI = size of region to mark (bytes)
    
===== Return =====

  if function successful
  Carry flag = clear
  
  if function unsuccessful
  Carry flag = set
  AX = error code
  8025H	invalid linear address (range unallocated)

===== Notes =====

Notifies the DPMI host that a range of pages may be placed at the head of the page-out candidate list, forcing these pages to be replaced ahead of other pages even if the memory has been accessed recently. The contents of the pages will be preserved.

This function does not force the pages to be swapped to disk immediately and should be treated as advisory only.

This function will always succeed on hosts that do not implement demand-paged virtual memory.

Partial pages will not be marked.

This function is useful, for example, if a client knows that a given piece of data will not be accessed for a long period of time. That data is ideal for swapping to disk so that the physical memory it occupies can be used for other purposes.
