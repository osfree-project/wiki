====== Int 2FH, AH=16H, AL=80H ======

===== Version =====

1.0

===== Brief =====

Release Current Virtual Machine's Time Slice

===== Input =====

	AX = 1680H

===== Return =====

 If function supported by host:
   AL = 0

 If function not supported by host:
   AL = unchanged (80H)

===== Notes =====

This function is not specific to DPMI hosts. Some operating systems will recognize this call for programs running in real mode. Programmers are encouraged to use this call 
in all DOS and DPMI-client programs. All DPMI hosts will hook Int 2FH and so a DPMI client can use this API without any other precautions. Non-DPMI programs that can run on DOS 
2.xx or earlier should make sure that the Int 2FH vector is non-zero before executing the Int 2FH.

When an application calls this function it will regain control at intervals, so it should continue to re-issue this function call so long as it has nothing to do.
DPMI client and application vendors are encouraged to use this function. It can significantly improve the performance of a DOS-based multitasking host.
