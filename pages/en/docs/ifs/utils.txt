====== Disk & filesystem maintance utilities and interfaces ======

-**proposal**-

===== Command line tools =====

Disk and filesystem maintance utilities consist of four command line tools. FORMAT, CHKDSK, SYSINST and RECOVER.

===== Utility library =====

As mentioned above, all disk and file maintance utilities just interface to actual functions. For each filesystem exists dynamic library with name U<FS>.DLL where <FS> is file system name. It contains four interfaces (as actual number of file system tools). Here interface of such functions:

  interface Disk
  {
    MakeBootable
    Check
    Recover
    Format
  }

==== OS/2 compatibility layer ====

For compatability with OS/2 supported following DLL entry points.


  SYS
  RECOVER
  FORMAT
  CHECKDSK
