===== L4Ka::Pistachio build =====

  - create directory //build//
  - cd to //build//
  - make -f //path_to_afterburner//
  - make menuconfig
  - deselect xen 3 or xen 2 (because we use only L4Ka:Pistachio)
  - select kernel to build. We propose to select 2.6.x kernel for real hardware.
  - make world, compilation can be stopped with error because problems with some header files generation.
  - cd to build pistachio-kernel-<arch>
  - make tcb_layout.h
  - make asmsyms.h
  - make kdb_class_helper.h
  - make kdb_autogenerated_protos.h
  - cd to root build dir
  - make world

**Note**: According to set of build tools you can have problems with build process. For example, GCC 4 not supported well. With latest binutils you need apply patch to some kernel inline instructions (available on kernel.org site). And so on.
