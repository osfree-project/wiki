======  Win16 Personality: A Windows 3.x Compatibility Layer ======
 
The Win16 Personality is a project to create a free, open-source reimplementation of the 16-bit Microsoft Windows 3.x operating environment. It aims to provide compatibility with Windows 3.0, Windows 3.1, and Windows 3.11 for running classic Win16 applications.

=====  Project Goals =====
 
  * Provide binary compatibility for a range of applications built for Windows 3.1/3.11.
  * Reimplement core system components: KERNEL.EXE, USER.EXE, GDI.EXE.
  * Serve as a research and educational platform for the classic Windows 3.x architecture.
  * Integrate the Win16 environment as one of the "Personalities" within the osFree microkernel OS, and ensure it can also run on pure DOS.

===== Current Status =====

The project is in early development (alpha stage). Current work focuses on the core 16-bit KERNEL. Critical GUI subsystems USER and GDI, required to run most Windows 3.x programs, are not yet implemented. The first practical milestone is to correctly run simple system utilities like WinVer.

=====  Components and Applications =====
 
As part of the project, clones of classic Windows 3.x applications are also being developed:
