===== Initial memory map =====

The standard PC has the following memory map:

^Addresses                    ^Name                              ^Description                                 ^
|0x000000-0x09FFFF     |Conventional memory      |RAM, which can be used by user|
|0x0A0000-0x0BFFFF     |Video memory                  |RAM, used by video adapter       |
|0x0C0000-0x0CFFFF    |Adapter's ROM                |ROM, used by different adapters|
|0x0D0000-0x0DFFFF    |Page Frame                     |RAM used to map Expanded memory|
|0x0E0000-0x0FFFFF     |BIOS                                |PC BIOS ROM|

Conventional memory mapped as:

^Addresses                    ^Name                               ^Description          ^

==== After boot record ====

This information correct for our [[en:boot:bootsector|bootsector]]

^Addresses                     ^Name                                 ^Description                    ^

|MuFSDStart-MuFSDEnd     |MicroFSD                        |MicroFSD/BlackBox code|
|(MuFSDEnd+1)-0x09FFFF  |Free Conventional memory |RAM, which can be used by user|
|0x0A0000-0x0BFFFF       |Video memory                    |RAM, used by video adapter|

|0x0E0000-0x0FFFFF        |BIOS                                 |PC BIOS ROM|

MuFSDStart=0x008000 or 0x090000. Now we use 0x090000 as LILO does but have a plan to use 0x008000 for more compact memory reuse and less possibility of overlapping.

MuFSDEnd is (0x008000+MicroFSD_file_length-1)

==== After MicroFSD/BlackBox ====

Memory map after MicroFSD/BlackBox work known via MemoryMap structure.

==== After FreeLDR ====

Memory map after FreeLDR work known via Multiboot Information block.

==== After L4Ka::Kickstart ====

Memory map after L4Ka:Kickstart work known to microkernel via Kernel Interface Page. Other tasks has access to memory via sigma0 server. Strating from this point all memory operation controlled by L4 microkernel.
