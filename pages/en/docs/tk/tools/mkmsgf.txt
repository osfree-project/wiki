MKMSGF infile[.ext] outfile[.ext] [/?] [/V] [/D <DBCS range or country>] [/P <code page>] [/L <language id,sub id>]

===== Arguments =====

  * infile - the input file that contains message definitions. The input-file name can be any valid OS/2 file name, optionally preceded by a drive letter and a path.
  * outfile field specifies the output file created by MKMSGF. The output-file name can be any valid OS/2 file name, optionally preceded by a drive letter and a path.

A valid DBCS range is: n10,n11,n20,n21,...,nn0,nn1

A single number is taken as a DBCS country code.

The valid OS/2 language/sublanguage ID values are:

Output File

The output file contains the indexed message file that DosGetMessage will use. The output-file name can be any valid OS/2 file name, optionally preceded by a drive letter and a path. The output file cannot have the same name as the input file.

To differentiate between the two files, the following convention is recommended, using the same file name.

    The infile file should have a .TXT extension.
    The outfile file should have a .MSG extension.

Help-message file names begin with the component identifier, followed by H.MSG. For example, the help file associated with the component identifier DOS would be DOSH.MSG.

Options

Text-based messages in different code pages can be created using MKMSGF to display errors, help information, prompt, or provide general information to the application user.

MKMSGF uses the following parameter formats to build message files:

  MKMSGF infile outfile /Pcodepage 
  MKMSGF infile outfile /Ddbcsrange or country id 
  MKMSGF infile outfile /LlangID,VerId 
  MKMSGF infile outfile /V 
  MKMSGF infile outfile /? 
  MKMSGF @controlfile 

    Infile is the ASCII-text source file.
    Outfile is the binary output message file.
    @controlfile is the message definition file.

Options Summary
  Type 	Meaning
  /P 	Code-page ID for the input message file.
  /D 	DbcsRange or country ID for the input message file.
  /L 	Language family ID (one word) and language version ID (one word).
  /V 	Verbose display of message file control variables as the message file is being created.
  /? 	Help display of command syntax for MKMSGF.
  
Note: Any combination of /P, /D, /L, and /V switches can be used for either the command line or @controlfile execution method.

The / switch prefix and the - prefix can be used interchangeably when defining switches to MKMSGF.

/Verbose Option Output Example

Following is a sample of MKMSGF output, using the Verbose option (/V). This output was produced using the following command:

mkmsgf myapp.txt myapp.msg /v

  strIn     = myapp.txt
  strOut    = myapp.msg
  StrIncDir = (null)
  CodePages = 437
  Language family id = 0 and sub id = 0
  Language family id and sub id = unspecified
  flags     = none
  CP_type   = SBCS
  "myapp.txt": length = 382 bytes.
  29 messages scanned.  Writing output file...
  Size of table entry: word

/P Option

The Code-page option (/P) specifies the code-page ID for that input message file.

For a complete list of code pages, see the code page table under COUNTRYCODE in the online book Control Program Programming Reference.

Up to 16 /P combinations can be saved with the message file.

/P cannot be used to identify DBCS data.

/D Option

The DBCS option (/D) specifies the DBCS Range or country ID for that input message file.

A valid DBCS country ID will cause the initialization of valid DBCS ranges to be set up for this file.

See DBCS Code Pages and Country Codes for valid DBCS country codes.
/L Option

The Language option (/L) specifies the language family ID (one word) and language version ID (one word).

Valid combination of language family and language version will be set for this file.

A valid language family with invalid or undefined language version id will cause a default value of 1 to be set for language version.
/A /C /I Options

I saw these and documented them as existing years ago, but never really looked at them in depth. I made some notes on a separate page: The A, C, and I Options.

/E

See the The Extended Structure page for more information. This tacks on what I call a fake extended header at the end of the file and updates the header offset.
Control Files

The control file (@controlfile) is used to create multiple-code-page message files. The at sign (@) is not part of the file name, but rather, a delimiter required before a control-file name.

The control file has the following format:

Example:

  root.in root. Out /Pcodepage /Ddbcsrang/ctryid /LlangID,VerId
  sub.001 sub1.out /Pcodepage /Ddbcsrang/ctryid /LlangID,VerId
                   .
                   .
  sub.00n subn.out /Pcodepage /Ddbcsrang/ctryid /LlangID,VerId

The help option (/?) is invalid due to the purpose of the definition file.

Note: Any combination of /P /D /L and /V switches can be used for either the command line or msg_definition_file execution method.
