Quick history:

  * SOM 1.0 - came out with OS/2 2.0 and used to build WorkPlaceShell. It includes only SOMObject, SOMClass and SOMClsMgr classes.
  * SOM 2.0 - aligned with CORBA 1.1, used CORBA IDL and added DSOM. SOM Compiler was reworked and Emitter Framework was added.
  * SOM 2.1 
  * SOM adopted by Apple to move OpenDoc from C++ to a language neutral framework.
  * SOM 3.0 - added IIOP support, referencing counting for SOMObject and more CORBA frameworks

SOM was available on OS/2 2.0 upwards, Windows NT, AIX 4, OS/390 and OS/400.

Why somFree?

This project provides a clean-room implementation of the major SOM components and is built to be very portable. The name comes from the method used to delete a SOMObject.

Main differences from IBM SOM

  - IDL compiler is a C++ program rather than a SOM based framework. This solves a chicken-and-egg problem.
  - Assembler is not used for thunking, somResolve() uses macros and apply/dispatch stubs.
  - Some components are just hollow stubs, such as SOMP.
  - Some components are not fully functional, eg somossvr.
  - You can have both C and C++ header files generated. The choice of 'somcorba' or 'somstars' comes from managing the 'SOMSTAR' macro.
  - No security functions implemented.

===== Changes =====

Changes from original somFree compiler:

  * Most of internal structures now also present as in old IBM SOM 2.1 NT Toolkit.
  * New emitters:
    * LNK - Open Watcom WLink support.
    * DUMP - displays structures, available to emitter.
    * PAS - Pascal client support.
    * IPAS - Pascal implementation classes support.
  * SOM Compiler library now mostly documented.
  * SOMLINK style functions for most of SOM Compiler library added.
  * Emitters now IBM SOM 2.1 and IBM SOM 3.0 compatible without recompilation.
  * somFree Compiler supports IBM SOM 2.1, IBM SOM 3.0, and somFree 1.0 emitters.
  * somtShowEntry function outputs more info.
  * Undocumented SOMTTypes now documented.
  * SOMIPC now supports IDL 4.2 specification.
  * CORBA C Language Mapping Specification 1.0 now supported by default instead of CORBA 1.1 C Language mapping.
  * Added support of OIDL files
