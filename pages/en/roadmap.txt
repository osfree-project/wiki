==== osFree RoadMap ====

osFree development must be attacked in several major stages - From a Command Line Inteface to the full Workplace Shell. Our current status in the chain is bolded.

=== Component implementation status ===

  * [[en:filesystems_support|Filesystems support]]

=== Steps to 1.0 ===

== 0.1 ==

In this version CPI implementation must be mostly finished. 16-bit API support not required. CMD.EXE and tools must be recompiled (because only sourcelevel compatability at this stage).

^Version                ^Requirements                     ^Status                    ^
|0.0.1                      |L4 must be loaded using GRUB and Hello, world application must be executed (as L4 root task). Hello, world application is stub for osFree kernel. |Done |
|0.0.2                      |EXT2FS must be finished (in general) and boot sequence must be implemented. GRUB must be removed. MicroFSD is 16-bit (OS/2 compatible), IFS is 32-bit (not OS/2 compatible). MicroFSD must load FreeLDR and execute it. FreeLDR must load L4 kernel and root task (osFree kernel stub). LILO must not be required for EXT2FS.  |Done |
|                              |**Note:** MiniFSD is absent because not required for microkernel architecture.  ||
|0.0.3                       |osFree kernel must parse CONFIG.SYS using file provider server (not real device driver loading) and show config tree. |Done |
|0.0.4                     |LX loader and module linker (using file provider). osFree kernel must allow load and execute PROTSHELL application.  |Done  |
|0.0.5                       |Filesystem API implementation. LX loader must allow loading of [[en:docs:cmd:minicmd|MINICMD.EXE]] task via [[en:docs:virtual_file_system_servers|L4VFS]] and execute it. [[en:minimal_set_of_api|Minimal set of API]]  must be implemented. All pointers operations must be replaced by handles (implement handle manager). [[en:docs:os2server|OS/2 Server]] must be more structured. Support of OS/2 memory map. **[[status:0.0.5|More...]]** |**In Progress** |
|0.0.6                       |VIO Server implementation. [[en:api:vio|VIO API]] implementation (32-bit version, via VIO Server). Console support instead of output to log server. Console output via nitpicker (write server like proxygon). |Not Done |
|0.0.7                       |[[en:api:kbd|KBD API]] implementation (32-bit version) |Not Done |
|0.0.8                       |Concurrent execution of many applications. Multithreaded applications. |Not Done |
|0.0.9                       |OpenWatcom and build tools must be recompiled as 32-bit version (no 16-bit API must be used). (LX format) |Not Done |
|0.0.10                     |CMD.EXE must be compiled and all required CPI for it must be implemented. (LX format, 32-bit API only) |Not Done |
|0.0.11                     |Self-compiled version of osFree. (LX format, no 16-bit API) |Not Done |
|0.0.12                     |Open Object REXX must be ported. (LX format, no 16-bit API) |Not Done |
