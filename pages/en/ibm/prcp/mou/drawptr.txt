==== MouDrawPtr ====

**Bindings**: [[drawptr#C bindings|C]], [[drawptr#MASM bindings|MASM]]

This call allows a process to notify the mouse device driver that an area previously restricted to the pointer image is now available to the mouse device driver. 

//MouDrawPtr// (**DeviceHandle**) 

//DeviceHandle// (**HMOU**) - input 
Mouse device handle from a previous [[open|MouOpen]]. 

//rc// (**USHORT**) - return 
Return code descriptions are: 

^0 ^NO_ERROR ^
|385 |ERROR_MOUSE_NO_DEVICE |
|466 |ERROR_MOU_DETACHED |
|501 |ERROR_MOUSE_NO_CONSOLE |
|505 |ERROR_MOU_EXTENDED_SG |

**Remarks** 

The collision area (the pointer image restricted area) is established by [[open|MouOpen]] and by [[removeptr|MouRemovePtr]]. [[drawptr|MouDrawPtr]] nullifies the effect of the [[removeptr|MouRemovePtr]] command. If there was no previous [[drawptr|MouDrawPtr]] command or if a previous [[drawptr|MouDrawPtr]] command has already nullified the collision area, the [[removeptr|MouRemovePtr]] command is effectively a null operation. 

This call is required to begin session pointer image drawing. Immediately after [[open|MouOpen]] is issued, the collision area is defined as the size of the display. A [[drawptr|MouDrawPtr]] is issued to begin pointer drawing after the [[open|MouOpen]]. 

=== C bindings ===

<code c>
#define INCL_MOU

USHORT  rc = MouDrawPtr(DeviceHandle);

HMOU             DeviceHandle;  /* Mouse device handle */

USHORT           rc;            /* return code */

=== MASM bindings ===

<code asm>
EXTRN  MouDrawPtr:FAR
INCL_MOU            EQU 1

PUSH   WORD    DeviceHandle  ;Mouse device handle
CALL   MouDrawPtr

Returns WORD
