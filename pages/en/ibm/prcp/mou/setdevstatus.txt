**Bindings**: [[setdevstatus#C bindings|C]], [[setdevstatus#MASM bindings|MASM]]

This call sets the mouse device driver status flags for the installed mouse device driver. 

//MouSetDevStatus// (DeviceStatus, DeviceHandle) 

//DeviceStatus// (**PUSHORT**) - input 
Address of the desired status flag settings. 

The passed parameter is a 2-byte set of flags. Only the high-order byte has meaning. 

^Bit ^Description ^
|15-10 |Reserved, set to zero. |
|9 Set |if mouse device is to return data in mickeys. |
|8 Set |if the drawing operations for the pointer draw routine are to be disabled. |
|7-0 |Reserved, set to zero. |

//DeviceHandle// (**HMOU**) - input 
Handle of the mouse device from a previous MouOpen. 

//rc// (**USHORT**) - return 
Return code descriptions are: 

|0 |NO_ERROR |
|385 |ERROR_MOUSE_NO_DEVICE |
|387 |ERROR_MOUSE_INV_PARMS |
|466 |ERROR_MOU_DETACHED |
|501 |ERROR_MOUSE_NO_CONSOLE |
|505 |ERROR_MOU_EXTENDED_SG |

**Remarks** 

[[en:ibm:prcp:mou:setdevstatus|MouSetDevStatus]] is the complement to [[en:ibm:prcp:mou:getdevstatus|MouGetDevStatus]]. However, not all status flags may be set with [[en:ibm:prcp:mou:setdevstatus|MouSetDevStatus]]. Only the flags corresponding to the following functions may be modified: 

  * Return data in mickeys. 
    * Normally, mouse data is returned to the application with the absolute display mode coordinates of the pointer image position on the display screen. By setting this status flag, mouse data is returned in relative mickeys, a unit of mouse movement. 
  * Don't call pointer draw device. 
    * Normally, the pointer draw device driver is called for all drawing operations. By setting this status flag, the mouse device driver does not call the pointer draw device driver. The application must draw any required pointer image on the screen.
