==== FS_FINDNOTIFYNEXT ====

**Purpose**

Resume reporting of changes to a file or directory.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FS_FINDNOTIFYNEXT(handle, pData, cbData, pcMatch, level,
                                 timeout)

unsigned short handle;
char far * pData;
unsigned short cbData;
unsigned short far * pcMatch;
unsigned short level;
unsigned long timeout;
</code>

**Where**

//handle// is the handle to the find-notify request.   

This handle was returned by the FSD and is associated with a previous //FS_FINDNOTIFYFIRST// or //FS_FINDNOTIFYNEXT// call.   

//pData// is the address of the application data area.   

Addressing of this data area is not validated by the kernel (see //FSH_PROBEBUF//). The FSD fills in this area with a set of packed, variable- length structures that contain the requested data and matching file names.   

//cbData// is the length of the application data area in bytes.   

//pcMatch// is a pointer to the number of matching entries.   

The FSD returns, at most, this number of entries. The FSD returns in this parameter the number of entries actually placed in the data area.   

The FSD does not need to verify this pointer.   

//level// is the information level to be returned.   

//Level// selects among a series of data structures to be returned. See the description of //DosFindNotifyFirst// in the OS/2 Version 2.0 Control Program Programming Reference for more information.   

The //level// passed to the FSD is valid.   

//timeout// is the time-out in milliseconds.   

The FSD waits until either the time-out has expired, the buffer is full, or the specified number of entries has been returned before returning to the caller. 

**Remarks**

//pcMatch// is the number of changes required to directories or files that match the //pName// target and //attr// specified during a related, previous //FS_FINDNOTIFYFIRST//. The file system uses this field to return the number of changes that actually occurred since the issue of the present //FS_FINDNOTIFYNEXT//.   

The //level// passed to //FS_FINDNOTIFYNEXT// is the same level as that passed to //FS_FINDNOTIFYFIRST// to initiate the search.
