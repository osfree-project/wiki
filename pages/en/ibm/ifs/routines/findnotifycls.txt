**Where**

//handle// is the directory handle.   

This handle was returned by the FSD on a previous //FS_FINDNOTIFYFIRST// or //FS_FINDNOTIFYNEXT// call. 

**Remarks**

Provides the mechanism for an FSD to release resources allocated on behalf of //FS_FINDNOTIFYFIRST// and //FS_FINDNOTIFYNEXT//.   

//FS_FINDNOTIFYFIRST// returns a handle to the find-notify request. //FS_FINDNOTIFYCLOSE// closes the handle associated with that find-notify request and releases file system information related to that handle.
