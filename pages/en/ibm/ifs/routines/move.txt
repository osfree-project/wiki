==== FS_MOVE ====

**Purpose**

Moves (renames) the specified file or subdirectory.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FS_MOVE(pcdfsi, pcdfsd, pSrc, iSrcCurDirEnd, pDst,
                       iDstCurDirEnd, flags)

struct cdfsi far * pcdfsi;
struct cdfsd far * pcdfsd;
char far * pSrc;
unsigned short iSrcCurDirEnd;
char far * pDst;
unsigned short iDstCurDirEnd;
unsigned short flags;
</code>

**Where**

//pcdfsi// is a pointer to the file-system-independent working directory structure.   

//pcdfsd// is a pointer to the file-system-dependent working directory structure.   

//pSrc// is a pointer to the ASCIIZ name of the source file or directory.   

The FSD does not need to verify this pointer.   

//iSrcCurDirEnd// is the index of the end of the current directory in //pSrc//.   

This is used to optimize FSD path processing. If //iSrcCurDirEnd// == -1 there is no current directory relevant to the source name text.   

//pDst// is a pointer to the ASCIIZ name of the destination file or directory.   

The FSD does not need to verify this pointer.   

//iDstCurDirEnd// is the index of the end of the current directory in //pDst//.   

This is used to optimize FSD path processing. If //iDstCurDirEnd// == -1 there is no current directory relevant to the destination name text.   

//flags// indicates destination name type.   

//Flags// == 0x0040 indicates non-8.3 filename format. All other values are reserved. 

**Remarks**

The file specified in filename should be moved to or renamed as the destination filename, if possible.   

Neither the source nor the destination filename may contain wildcard characters.   

//FS_MOVE// may be used to change the case in filenames.   

The non-8.3 filename format attribute in the directory entry for the destination name should be set according to the value in flags.   

In the case of a subdirectory move, the system does the following checking:   

  * No files in this directory or its subdirectories are open. 
  * This directory or any of its subdirectories is not the current directory for any process in the system. 

In addition, the system also checks for circularity in source and target directory names; that is, the source directory is not a prefix of the target directory.   

Note:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. Therefore, an FSD should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
