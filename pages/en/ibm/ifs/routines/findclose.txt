==== FS_FINDCLOSE ====

**Purpose**

Provides the mechanism for an FSD to release resources allocated on behalf of //FS_FINDFIRST// and //FS_FINDNEXT//.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FS_FINDCLOSE(pfsfsi, pfsfsd)

struct fsfsi far * pfsfsi;
struct fsfsd far * pfsfsd;
</code>

**Where**

//pfsfsi// is a pointer to the file-system-independent file search structure.   

The FSD should not update this structure.   

//pfsfsd// is a pointer to the file-system-dependent file search structure.   

The FSD may use this to store information about continuation of its search. 

**Remarks** 

//DosFindClose// has been called on the handle associated with the search buffer. Any file system related information may be released.   

If //FS_FINDFIRST// for a particular search returns an error, an //FS_FINDCLOSE// for that search will not be issued.
