==== FS_RMDIR ====

**Purpose**

Removes a subdirectory from the specified disk.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FS_RMDIR(pcdfsi, pcdfsd, pName, iCurDirEnd)

struct cdfsi far * pcdfsi;
struct cdfsd far * pcdfsd;
char far * pName;
unsigned short iCurDirEnd;
</code>

**Where**

//pcdfsi// is a pointer to the file-system-independent working directory structure.   

//pcdfsd// is a pointer to the file-system-dependent working directory structure.   

//pName// is a pointer to the ASCIIZ name of the directory to be removed.   

The FSD does not need to verify this pointer.   

//iCurDirEnd// is the index of the end of the current directory in //pName//.   

This is used to optimize FSD path processing. If //iCurDirEnd// == -1, there is no directory relevant to the name text, that is a device. 

**Remarks**

OS/2 assures that the directory being removed is not the current directory nor the parent of any current directory of any process.   

The FSD should not remove any directory that has entries other than '.' and '..' in it.
