==== FS_FILEATTRIBUTE ====

**Purpose**

Query/Set the attribute of the specified file.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FS_FILEATTRIBUTE(flag, pcdfsi, pcdfsd, pName, iCurDirEnd,
                                pAttr)

unsigned short flag;
struct cdfsi far * pcdfsi;
struct cdfsd far * pcdfsd;
char far * pName;
unsigned short iCurDirEnd;
unsigned short far * pAttr;
</code>

**Where**

^//flag// ^indicates retrieval or setting of attributes, with:   ^
|//flag// == 0 |indicates retrieving the attribute. |
|//flag// == 1 |indicates setting the attribute. |
|//flag// == all |other values, reserved.   |

The value of //flag// passed to the FSD will be valid.   

//pcdfsi// is a pointer to the file-system independent portion of an open file instance.   

//pcdfsd// is a pointer to the file-system dependent portion of an open file instance.   

//pName// is a pointer to the ASCIIZ name of the file or directory.   

The FSD does not need to validate this pointer.   

//iCurDirEnd// is the index of the end of the current directory in pName.   

This is used to optimize FSD path processing. If //iCurDirEnd// == -1, there is no current directory relevant to the name text, that is, a device.   

//pAttr// is a pointer to the attribute.

|For //flag// == 0, |the FSD should store the attribute in the indicated location. |
|For //flag// == 1, |the FSD should retrieve the attribute from this location and set it in the file or directory.   |

The FSD does not need to validate this pointer.
