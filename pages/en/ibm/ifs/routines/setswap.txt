==== FS_SETSWAP ====

**Purpose**

Perform whatever actions are necessary to support the swapper.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FS_SETSWAP(psffsi, psffsd)

struct sffsi far * psffsi;
struct sffsd far * psffsd;
</code>

**Where**

//psffsi// is a pointer to the file-system-independent portion of an open file instance of the swapper file.   

//psffsd// is a pointer to the file-system-dependent portion of an open file instance. 

**Remarks**

Swapping does not begin until this call returns successfully. This call is made during system initialization.   

The FSD makes all segments that are relevant to swap-file I/O non-swappable (see //FSH_FORCENOSWAP//). This includes any data and code segments accessed during a read or write.   

Any FSD that manages writeable media may be the swapper file system.   

//FS_SETSWAP// may be called more than once for the same or different volumes or FSDs.
