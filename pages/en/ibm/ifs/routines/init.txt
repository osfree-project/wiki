==== FS_INIT ====

**Purpose**

Request file system driver initialization.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FS_INIT(szParm, DevHelp, pMiniFSD)

char far * szParm;
unsigned long DevHelp;
unsigned long far * pMiniFSD;
</code>

**Where**

//szParm// is a pointer to the ASCIIZ parameters following the CONFIG.SYS IFS= command that loaded the FSD. The FSD does not need to verify this pointer.   

//DevHelp// is the address of the kernel entry point for the DevHelp routines.   

This is used exactly as the device driver DevHelp address, and can be used by an FSD that needs access to some of the device helper services.   

//pMiniFSD// is a pointer to data passed between the mini-FSD and the FSD, or null. 

**Remarks**

This call is made during system initialization to allow the FSD to perform actions necessary for beginning operation. The FSD may successfully initialize by returning 0 or may reject installation (invalid parameters, incompatible hardware, etc.) by returning the appropriate error code. If rejection is selected, all FSD selectors and segments are released.   

//pMiniFSD// will be null, except when booting from a volume managed by an FSD and the exported name of the FSD matches the exported name of the mini-FSD. In this case, //pMiniFSD// will point to data established by the mini-FSD (See MFS_INIT).
