==== FS_DELETE ====

**Purpose**

Removes a directory entry associated with a filename.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FS_DELETE(pcdfsi, pcdfsd, pFile, iCurDirEnd)

struct cdfsi far * pcdfsi;
struct cdfsd far * pcdfsd;
char far * pFile;
unsigned short iCurDirEnd;
</code>

**Where**

//pcdfsi// is a pointer to the file-system-independent working directory structure.   

//pcdfsd// is a pointer to the file-system-dependent working directory structure.   

//pFile// is a pointer to the ASCIIZ name of the file or directory. The FSD does not need to validate this pointer.   

//iCurDirEnd// is the index of the end of the current directory in pFile.   

This is used to optimize FSD path processing. If //iCurDirEnd// == -1, there is no current directory relevant to the name text, that is, a device. 

**Remarks**

The files specified are deleted.   

The deletion of a file opened in DOS mode by the same process requesting the delete is supported. OS/2 calls //FS_CLOSE// for the file before calling //FS_DELETE//.   

The file name may not contain wildcard characters.
