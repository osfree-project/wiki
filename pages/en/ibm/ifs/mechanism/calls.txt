==== File System Function Calls ====

The OS/2 Version 2.0 Control Program Programming Reference gives a detailed description of the 32-bit file system calls new for OS/2 Version 2.0 See the OS/2 Version 2.0 Programming Guide for a description of how to use these calls. For detailed descriptions of the 16-bit file system calls see the OS/2 Version 1.3 Control Program Programming Reference, and the OS/2 Version 1.3 Programming Guide on how to use these calls.   

Note: The data structures for some of the file system calls have changed in their 32-bit implementations. For OS/2 Version 2.0 the kernel will handle all remapping between the 32-bit structures and the 16-bit structures used by individual FSDs.
