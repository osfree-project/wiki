==== IFS Commands ====

An FSD is loaded and initialized at system start-up when an IFS= statement is encountered in CONFIG.SYS. The syntax of this command is as follows:   

<code>
IFS=drive:path\name.ext parms
</code>

where 
drive:path\name.ext specifies the FSD to load and initialize.   
parms represents an FSD-defined string of initialization parameters. 

See the OS/2 Version 2.0 Online Command Reference for a detailed description of this command.
