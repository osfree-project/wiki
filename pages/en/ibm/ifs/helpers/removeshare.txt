==== FSH_REMOVESHARE ====

**Purpose**

This function removes a previously-entered name from the sharing set.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
void far pascal FSH_REMOVESHARE(hShare)

unsigned long hShare;
</code>

**Where**

//hShare// is a share handle returned by a prior call to //FSH_ADDSHARE//. 

**Returns**

There are no error returns.   

**Remarks**

When a call to //FSH_REMOVESHARE// has been issued, the share handle is no longer valid.   

//FSH_REMOVESHARE// may block.   

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. An FSD, therefore, should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
