==== FSH_CHECKEANAME ====

**Purpose**

Check extended attribute name validity.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FSH_CHECKEANAME(iLevel, cbEAName, szEAName)

unsigned short iLevel;
unsigned long cbEAName;
char far * szEAName;
</code>

**Where**

//iLevel// is the extended attributes name checking level.   

//iLevel// = 0x0001 indicates OS/2 Version 2.0 name checking.   

//cbEAName// is the length of the extended attribute name, not including terminating NUL.   

//szEAName// is the extended attribute name to check for validity. 

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, one of the following error codes is returned:   

  * ERROR_INVALID_NAME -- pathname contains invalid or wildcard characters, or is too long.
  * ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER -- invalid level. 

**Remarks**

This routine processes DBCS characters properly.   

The set of invalid characters for EA names is the same as that for filenames. In OS/2 Version 2.0, the maximum length of an EA name, not including the terminating NUL, is 255 bytes. The minimum length is 1 byte.   

The FSD is responsible for verifying the string pointers and checking for segment boundaries.   

//FSH_CHECKEANAME// should be called for extended attribute names passed to the FSD.   

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. Therefore, an FSD should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
