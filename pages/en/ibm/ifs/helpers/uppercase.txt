==== FSH_UPPERCASE ====

**Purpose**

This function is used to uppercase an ASCIIZ string.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FSH_UPPERCASE(szPathName, cbPathBuf, pPathBuf)

char far * szPathName;
unsigned short cbPathBuf;
char far * pPathBuf;
</code>

**Where**

//szPathName// is a pointer to the ASCIIZ pathname to be uppercased.   

//cbPathBuf// is the length of the pathname buffer.   

//pPathBuf// is a pointer to the buffer to copy the uppercased path into 

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, the following error code is returned:   

  * ERROR_BUFFER_OVERFLOW -- uppercased pathname is too long to fit into buffer. 

**Remarks**

This routine processes DBCS characters properly.   

The FSD is responsible for verifying the string pointers and checking for segment boundaries.   

//szPathName// and //pPathBuf// may point to the same place in memory.   

//FSH_UPPERCASE// should be called for names passed into the FSD in raw data packets which are not passed to //FSH_CANONICALIZE// and should be uppercased, that is, extended attribute names.   

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. Therefore, an FSD should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
