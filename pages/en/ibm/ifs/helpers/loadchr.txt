==== FSH_LOADCHAR ====

**Purpose**

This function provides the mechanism for loading a character from a string, taking into account DBCS considerations.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
void far pascal FSH_LOADCHAR(ppStr, pChar)

char far * far * ppStr;
unsigned short far * pChar;
</code>

**Where**

//ppStr// is a pointer to the character pointer of a string.   

The character at this location will be retrieved and this pointer will be updated.   

//pChar// is a pointer to the character returned.   

If character is non-DBCS, the first byte will be the character and the second byte will be zero. 

**Returns**

There are no error returns.   

**Remarks**

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. An FSD, therefore, should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
