==== FSH_SETVOLUME ====

**Purpose**

This function provides the mechanism for assuring that a desired volume is in a removable media drive before I/O is done to the drive.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FSH_SETVOLUME(hVPB , fControl)

unsigned short hVPB;
unsigned short fControl;
</code>

**Where**

//hVPB// is the volume handle for the source of I/O.   

//fControl// is the bit mask of pop-up control actions:   

|Bit 0 off |indicates volume change pop-up desired |
|Bit 0 on |indicates no volume change pop-up  |
|All other bits are reserved and must be zero. ||

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, one of the following error codes is returned:   

  * ERROR_VOLUME_CHANGED -- is an indication that removable media volume change has occurred. 
  * ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER -- the fControl flag word has reserved bits on. 

**Remarks**

This routine is used by the //FSH_CALLDRIVER// routine to insure that the desired volume is in a removable media drive. FSDs can use it for the same purpose.   

//FSH_SETVOLUME// may block.   

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. An FSD, therefore, should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
