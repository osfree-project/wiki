==== FSH_REGISTERPERFCTRS ====

**Purpose**

This function allows the FSD to register with the PERFVIEW product. The FSD passes pointers to its counter data and text blocks.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FSH_REGISTERPERFCTRS(pDataBlk, pTextBlk, fsFlags)

void far * pDataBlk;
void far * pTextBlk;
unsigned short fsFlags;
</code>
  
**Where**

//pDataBlk// is a pointer to the data block where the actual counters reside.   

//pTextBlk// is a pointer to the block that contains instance and name information about counters in the associated //DataBlk//.   

//fsFlags// indicates what type of addressing is going to be used.   

|Bit 0 off |indicates 16:16 pointers |
|Bit 0 on |indicates 0:32 pointers   |

All other bits are reserved and must be zero. 

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, one of the following error codes is returned:   

  * ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER -- the flag word is invalid.  
  * ERROR_PVW_INVALID_COUNTER_BLK -- the specified buffer is not in the correct PERFVIEW data block format  
  * ERROR_PVW_INVALID_TEXT_BLK -- the specified buffer is not in the correct PERFVIEW text block format 

**Remarks**

For a detailed description of the PERFVIEW interface and its associated data structures please see the OS/2 Version 2.0 PERFVIEW OEMI Document.   

//FSH_REGISTERPERFCTRS// may block.   

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. An FSD, therefore, should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
