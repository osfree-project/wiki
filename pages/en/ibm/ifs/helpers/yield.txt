==== FSH_YIELD ====

**Purpose**

This function provides the mechanism for relinquishing the processor to higher priority threads.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
void far pascal FSH_YIELD(void)
</code>

**Returns**

There are no error returns.   

**Remarks**

FSDs run under the 2 mS dispatch latency imposed on the OS/2 kernel, meaning that no more than 2 mS can be spent in an FSD without an explicit block or yield. //FSH_YIELD// will test to see if another thread is runable at the current thread's priority or at a higher priority. If one exists, that thread will be given a chance to run.
