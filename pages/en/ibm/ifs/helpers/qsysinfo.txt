==== FSH_QSYSINFO ====

**Purpose**

This function queries the system about dynamic system variables and static system variables not returned by //DosQSysInfo//.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FSH_QSYSINFO(index, pData, cbData)

unsigned short index;
char far * pData;
unsigned short cbData;
</code>

**Where**

//index// is the variable to return.   

//index// == 1 indicates maximum sector size.   

//index// == 2 indicates process identity. The data returned will be as follows:   

<code c>
struct {
    unsigned short PID;
    unsigned short UID;
    unsigned short PDB;
}
</code>

//index// == 3 indicates absolute thread number for the current thread. This will be returned in an unsigned short field.   

//index// == 4 indicates verify on write flag for the process. This will be returned in an unsigned char (byte) field. Zero means verify is off, non-zero means it is on.   

//pData// is the long address to the data area.   

//cbData// is the length of the data area. 

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, one of the following error codes is returned:   

  * ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER -- the index is invalid. 
  * ERROR_BUFFER_OVERFLOW  -- the specified buffer is too short for the returned data. 

**Remarks**

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. An FSD, therefore, should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
