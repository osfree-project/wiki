==== FSH_FINDCHAR ====

**Purpose**

This function provides the mechanism to find the first occurrence of any one of a set of characters in an ASCIIZ string, taking into account DBCS considerations.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FSH_FINDCHAR(nChars, pChars, ppStr)

unsigned short nChars;
char far * pChars;
char far * far * ppStr;
</code>

**Where**

//nChars// is the number of characters in the search list.   

//pChars// is the array of characters to search for. These cannot be DBCS characters.   

The NUL character cannot be searched for.   

//ppSTR// is the pointer to the character pointer where the search is to begin. This pointer is updated upon return to point to the character found. This must be an ASCIIZ string. 

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, one of the following error codes is returned:   

  * ERROR_CHAR_NOT_FOUND -- indicates none of the characters were found. 

**Remarks**

The search will continue until a matching character is found or the end of the string is found.   

The FSD is responsible for verifying the string pointers and checking for segment boundaries.   

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. An FSD, therefore, should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
