==== FSH_GETVOLPARM ====

**Purpose**

This function allows an FSD to retrieve file-system-independent and file-system-dependent data from a VPB. Since the FS router passes in a VPB handle, individual FSDs need to map the handle into pointers to the relevant portions.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
void far pascal FSH_GETVOLPARM(hVPB, ppVPBfsi, ppVPBfsd)

unsigned short hVPB;
struc vpfsi far * far * ppVPBfsi;
struc vpfsd far * far * ppVPBfsd;
</code>

**Where**

//hVPB// is the volume handle of interest.   

//ppVPBfsi// indicates the location where the pointer to file-system-independent data is stored.   

//ppVPBfsd// indicates the location where the pointer to file-system-dependent data is stored. 

**Returns**

There are no error returns.   

**Remarks**

//FSH_GETVOLPARM// will not block.   

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. An FSD, therefore, should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
