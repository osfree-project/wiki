==== FSH_SEGFREE ====

**Purpose**

This function releases a GDT or LDT segment previously allocated with //FSH_SEGALLOC// or loaded as part of the FSD image.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FSH_SEGFREE(sel)

unsigned short sel;
</code>

**Where**

//sel// is the selector to be freed. 

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, one of the following error codes is returned:   

  * ERROR_INVALID_ACCESS -- the selector is invalid. 

**Remarks**

//FSH_SEGFREE// may block.   

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. An FSD, therefore, should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
