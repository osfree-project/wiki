==== FSH_SEGREALLOC ====

**Purpose**

This function changes the size of a segment previously allocated with //FSH_SEGALLOC// or loaded as part of the FSD image.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FSH_SEGREALLOC(sel, cbSeg)

unsigned short sel;
unsigned long cbSeg;
</code>

**Where**

//sel// is the selector to be changed.   

//cbSeg// is the new size to set for the segment. 

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, one of the following error codes is returned:   

  * ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY -- too much memory is allocated. 
  * ERROR_INVALID_ACCESS -- the selector is invalid 

**Remarks**

The segment may be grown or shrunk. The segment may be moved in the process. When grown, the extra space is uninitialized.   

//FSH_SEGREALLOC// may block.   

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. An FSD, therefore, should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
