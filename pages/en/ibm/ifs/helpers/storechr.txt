==== FSH_STORECHAR ====

**Purpose**

This function provides the mechanism for storing a character into a string, taking into account DBCS considerations.   

Calling Sequence 

<code c>
int far pascal FSH_STORECHAR(chDBCS, ppStr)

unsigned short chDBCS;
char far * far * ppStr;
</code>

**Where**

//chDBCS// is the character to be stored. This may be either a single-byte character or a double-byte character with the first byte occupying the low-order position.   

//ppStr// is the pointer to the character pointer where the character will be stored. This pointer is updated upon return. 

**Returns**

There are no error returns.   

**Remarks**

The FSD is responsible for verifying the string pointer and checking for segment boundaries.   

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. An FSD, therefore, should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
