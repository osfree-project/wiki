==== FSH_PREVCHAR ====

**Purpose**

This function provides the mechanism for decrementing a character point, taking into account DBCS considerations.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
void far pascal FSH_PREVCHAR(pBeg, ppStr)

char far * pBeg;
char far * far * ppStr;
</code>

**Where**

//pBeg// is a pointer to the beginning of a string.   

//ppStr// is a pointer to the character pointer of a string.   

The value is decremented appropriately upon return. If it is at the beginning of a string, the pointer is not decremented. If it points to the second byte of a DBCS character, it will be decremented to point to the first byte of the character. 

**Returns**

There are no error returns.   

**Remarks**

The FSD is responsible for verifying the string pointer and checking for segment boundaries.   

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. An FSD, therefore, should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
