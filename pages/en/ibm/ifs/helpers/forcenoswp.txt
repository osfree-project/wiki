==== FSH_FORCENOSWAP ====

**Purpose**

This function permanently forces segments into memory.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FSH_FORCENOSWAP(sel)

unsigned short sel;
</code>

**Where**

//sel// is the selector that is to be made non-swappable. 

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, one of the following error codes is returned:   

  * ERROR_INVALID_ACCESS  -- indicates the selector is invalid. 
  * ERROR_INVALID_DENIED -- indicates the selector is invalid or the sector belongs to another process. 
  * ERROR_DIRECT_ACCESS_HANDLE -- indicates the handle does not refer to a segment. 
  * ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY -- indicates there is not enough physical memory to make a segment nonswappable. 
  * ERROR_SWAP_TABLE_FULL -- indicates the attempt to grow the swap file failed. 
  * ERROR_SWAP_FILE_FULL -- indicates the attempt to grow the swap file failed. 
  * ERROR_PMM_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY -- indicates the attempt to grow the swap file failed. 
  
**Remarks**

An FSD may call //FSH_FORCENOSWAP// to force segments to be loaded into memory and marked non-swappable. All segments both in the load image of the FSD and those allocated via //FSH_SEGALLOC// are eligible to be marked. There is no way to undo the effect of //FSH_FORCENOSWAP//.   

If an FSD is notified it is managing the swapping media, it should make this call for the necessary segments.   

An FSD should be prepared to see multiple swapping files on more than one volume in 80386 processors and in future releases of OS/2.   

//FSH_FORCENOSWAP// may block.   

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. An FSD, therefore, should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
