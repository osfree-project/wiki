==== FSH_SEMSET ====

**Purpose**

This function allows an FSD to set a semaphore unconditionally.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FSH_SEMSET(pSem)

void far * pSem;
</code>

**Where**

//pSem// is the handle to the system semaphore or the long address of the ram semaphore. 

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, one of the following error codes is returned:   

  * ERROR_INTERRUPT -- the current thread received a signal. 
  * ERROR_EXCL_SEM_ALREADY_OWNED -- the exclusive semaphore is already owned. 
  * ERROR_TOO_MANY_SEM_REQUESTS -- there are too many semaphore requests in progress. 
  * ERROR_PROTECTION_VIOLATION -- the semaphore is inaccessible. 

**Remarks**

//FSH_SEMSET// may block.   

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. An FSD, therefore, should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
