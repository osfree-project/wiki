==== FSH_IOSEMCLEAR ====

**Purpose**

This function allows an FSD to clear the I/O event semaphore that is a part of the Extended Strategy request packet.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FSH_IOSEMCLEAR(pSem)
</code>

**Where**

//pSem// is the handle to the I/O event semaphore. 

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, one of the following error codes is returned:   

  * ERROR_EXCL_ALREADY_OWNED -- the exclusive semaphore is already owned. 
  * ERROR_PROTECTION_VIOLATION -- the semaphore is inaccessible. 

**Remarks**

//FSH_IOSEMCLEAR// may block.   

For a detailed description of the Extended Strategy request interface, please see the OS/2 Version 2.0 Physical Device Driver Reference   

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. An FSD, therefore, should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
