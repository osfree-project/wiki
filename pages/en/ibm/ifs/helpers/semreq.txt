==== FSH_SEMREQUEST ====

**Purpose**

This function allows an FSD to obtain exclusive access to a semaphore.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal FSH_SEMREQUEST(pSem, cmsTimeout)

void far * pSem;
unsigned long cmsTimeout;
</code>

**Where**

//pSem// is the handle to the system semaphore or the long address of the ram semaphore.   

//cmsTimeout// is the number of milliseconds to wait. 

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, one of the following error codes is returned:   

  * ERROR_INTERRUPT -- the current thread received a signal. 
  * ERROR_SEM_TIMEOUT -- the time-out expired without gaining access to the semaphore. 
  * ERROR_SEM_OWNER_DIED -- the owner of the semaphore died. 
  * ERROR_TOO_MANY_SEM_REQUESTS -- there are too many semaphore requests in progress. 
  * ERROR_PROTECTION_VIOLATION -- the semaphore is inaccessible. 

**Remarks**

The time-out value of 0xFFFFFFFF indicates an indefinite time-out.   

The caller may receive access to the semaphore after the time-out period has expired without receiving an ERROR_SEM_TIMEOUT. Semaphore time-out values, therefore, should not be used for exact timing and sequencing.   

//FSH_SEMREQUEST// may block.   

**Note**:   OS/2 does not validate input parameters. An FSD, therefore, should call //FSH_PROBEBUF// where appropriate.
