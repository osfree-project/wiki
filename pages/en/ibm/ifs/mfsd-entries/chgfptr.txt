==== MFS_CHGFILEPTR - Move a file's position pointer ====

**Purpose**

Move the file's logical read position pointer.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal MFS_CHGFILEPTR(offset, type)

long offset;
unsigned short type;
</code>

**Where**

//offset// is the signed offset which depending on the type parameter is used to determine the new position within the file.   

//type// indicates the basis of a seek operation. 

|type == 0 |indicates seek relative to beginning of file. |
|type == 1 |indicates seek relative to current position within the file. |
|type == 2 |indicates seek relative to end of file. |

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, a non-zero error code is returned.   

**Remarks**

The file system may want to take the seek operation as a hint that an I/O operation is about to take place at the new position and initiate a positioning operation on sequential access media or read-ahead operation on other media.
