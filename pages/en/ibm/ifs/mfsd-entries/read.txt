==== MFS_READ - Read from a file ====

**Purpose**

Read the specified number of bytes from the file to a buffer location.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal MFS_READ(pcData, pusLength)

char far * pcData;
unsigned long far * pusLength;
</code>

**Where**

//pcData// is a pointer to the data area to be read into. The data area is guaranteed to be below the 1-Meg boundary.   

//pusLength// is a pointer to a word which on entry specifies the number of bytes to be read. On return, it is filled in by the mini-FSD with the number of bytes successfully read. 

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, a non-zero error code is returned.   

**Remarks**

The current file position is advanced by the number of bytes read.
