==== MFS_TERM - Terminate the mini-FSD ====

**Purpose**

Inform the mini-FSD that it should prepare itself for termination.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal MFS_TERM(void)
</code>

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, a non-zero error code is returned.   

**Remarks**

The system will NOT free any memory explicitly allocated by the mini-FSD through //MFSH_SEGALLOC// or //FSH_SEGALLOC//. It must be explicitly freed by the mini-FSD. (Memory allocated by the mini-FSD and 'given' to the FSD need not be freed.) The system will free all of the segments loaded as part of the mini-FSD image immediately after this call.
