==== Installable File System Mechanism ====

The OS/2 Installable File System (IFS) Mechanism supports the following:   

  * Coexistence of multiple, active file systems in a single PC 
  * Multiple logical volumes (partitions) 
  * Multiple and different storage devices 
  * Redirection or connection to remote file systems 
  * File system flexibility in managing its data and I/O for optimal performance 
  * Transparency at both the user and application level 
  * Standard set of File I/O API 
  * Existing logical file and directory structure 
  * Existing naming conventions 
  * File system doing its own buffer management 
  * File system doing file I/O without intermediate buffering 
  * Extensions to the Standard File I/O API (FSCTL) 
  * Extensions to the existing naming conventions 
  * IOCTL type of communication between a file system and a device driver
