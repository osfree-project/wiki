==== MFSH_SETBOOTDRIVE - Change boot drive number kept by the OS/2 kernel ====

**Purpose**

Change boot drive number kept by the kernel to allow a change in the assignment of boot drive as seen by later processes.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal MFSH_SETBOOTDRIVE(usDrive)

unsigned short usDrive;
</code>

**Where**

//usDrive// contains the 0-based drive number that the mini-FSD wants the system to consider as the boot drive. 

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, on of the following error codes is returned:   

  * ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER -- the supplied drive number is invalid. 

**Remarks**

This call changes the boot drive number that is kept in the global info segment of the system. Valid values range from 2 (=C) to 25 (=Z). This function must be called during the call to //MFS_INIT// to update the info segment correctly. This is routine should be used by RIPL mini-FSDs.
