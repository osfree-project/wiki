==== MFSH_SEGREALLOC - Change segment size ====

**Purpose**

Change the size of memory.   

**Calling Sequence**

<code c>
int far pascal MFSH_SEGREALLOC(usSel, cbSeg)

unsigned short usSel;
unsigned long cbSeg;
</code>

**Where**

//usSel// contains the selector of the segment to be resized.   

//cbSeg// contains the new length of the segment. 

**Returns**

If no error is detected, a zero error code is returned. If an error is detected, on of the following error codes is returned:   

  * ERROR_NOT_MEMORY -- too much memory is allocated. 
  * ERROR_PROTECTION_VIOLATION -- the supplied selector is invalid. 
  * ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER -- the supplied length is invalid. 

**Remarks**

This call changes the size of a segment previously allocated with //MFSH_SEGALLOC//, or loaded as part of the mini-FSD image.   

The segment may be grown or shrunk. When grown, the extra space is uninitialized. The segment may be moved in the process.
