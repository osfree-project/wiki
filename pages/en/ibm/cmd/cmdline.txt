===== The Command Line =====

**CMD.EXE** displays a **[c:\]** prompt when it is waiting for you to enter a 
command.  (The actual text depends on the current drive and directory as 
well as your **PROMPT** settings.)  This is called the command line and the 
prompt is asking you to enter a command, an alias or batch file name, or 
the instructions necessary to begin an application program. 
This section explains the features that will help you while you are typing 
in commands, and how keystrokes are interpreted when you enter them at the 
command line.  The keystrokes discussed here are the ones normally used by 
**CMD.EXE**.  If you prefer using different keystrokes to perform these 
functions, you can assign new ones with key mapping directives in **CMD.INI**.
