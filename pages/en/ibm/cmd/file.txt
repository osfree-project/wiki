===== File Selection =====

Most internal commands (like **COPY**, **DIR**, etc.) work on a file or a group of 
files.  Besides typing the exact name of the file you want to work with, 
you can use several shorthand forms for naming or selecting files and the 
applications associated with them. 
Most of the features explained in this section apply to **CMD.EXE** commands 
only, and can not be used to pass file names to external programs unless 
those programs were specifically written to support these features. 

The file selection features are: 

  * [[en:docs:os2:cmd:file:parentdir|Extended Parent Directory Names]]
  * [[en:docs:os2:cmd:file:wild|Wildcards]]
  * [[en:docs:os2:cmd:file:ranges|Date, Time, and Size Ranges]]
  * [[en:docs:os2:cmd:file:exclusion|File Exclusion Ranges]]
  * [[en:docs:os2:cmd:file:mult|Multiple Filenames]]
  * [[en:docs:os2:cmd:file:incl|Include Lists]]
  * [[en:docs:os2:cmd:file:ext|Executable Extensions]]
