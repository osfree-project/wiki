You can view the command history in a scrollable command history window, and select the command to modify or re-execute from those displayed in the window. To activate the command history window press **PgUp** or **PgDn** at the command line. A window will appear in the upper right corner of the screen, with the command you most recently executed marked with a highlight. (If you just finished re-executing a command from the history, then the next command in sequence will be highlighted.) 

The display is not circular as it is at the prompt; it has a fixed beginning and end. The **Ctrl-D** (delete from history) key works within the history window as it does at the command line. 

Once you have selected a command in the history window, press Enter to execute it immediately, or **Ctrl-Enter** to move the line to the prompt for editing (you cannot edit the line directly in the history window). 

You can bring up a "filtered" history window by typing some characters on the command line, then pressing **PgUp** or **PgDn**. Only those commands matching the typed characters will be displayed in the window. 

See [[en:docs:os2:cmd:ref:misc:popup-win|Popup Windows]] for information on customizing window position, size, and color.
