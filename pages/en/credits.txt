osFree project does not aim to rewrite everything from scratch. We realize that our resources are limited. So, we must reuse existing code as much as possible. We have already taken a number of [[wp>FOSS]] and Public domain software as a base of our [[wp>Operating_System|OS]] components. Here is their list (may be, incomplete, sorry if it is).

Much thanks to those projects: (software or documentation)

  * [[http://regina-rexx.sourceforge.net/|Regina REXX]] - our Classic REXX replacement
  * [[http://hessling-editor.sourceforge.net/|THE]] - our TEDIT replacement
  * And lot of other things from Mark Hessling. His products allowed us not to reinvent the wheel.
  * [[http://os2linux.sourceforge.net/|OS2Linux]] project as a base for CPI implementation on top of Fiasco microkernel.
  * [[http://frepm.sourceforge.net/|FreePM]] project as base of PM reimplementation
