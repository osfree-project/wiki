We released this preview to show actual possibility of LX executables (native OS/2 executable file format) to be run on top of L4. Output from LX executable is "I am really small!" phrase. Other things is debug output. Our executable uses msg.dll which uses doscalls.dll. So, linking also works. Also we present here osFree loader which allow to load as Multiboot compatible kernels as native OS/2 kernel. Loader is moduler and easy to extend. Next release will provide some interactive like directory browsing and files execution. See roadmap at http://www.osfree.org for more info.
